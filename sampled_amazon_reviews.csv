Bushnell Powerview 16x50 Binocular,it would've been stupid to trash,"April 24, 2018",1,"so, these are the SECOND Bushnell Powerview 16 x 50 binoculars...right? they BOTH had double vision! On the first pair, I trashed them...my stupidity (well...if the warranty was true, it would've been stupid to trash..but...read on)...so I buy a second pair later on....they have double vision...so this time I pull out my binoc folder...see that it has a ""lifetime warranty""..call Bushnell, spoke to ""Travis"", explained all...he says well, if you still had the first ones, you could've returned them to us...so I said, well I have the second ones...so...per his instructions and direction, I returned the binocs (I had to pay $14 shippping)...because I was informed that Bushnell would either 1. repair or 2. replace.....After a month's time, I receive a letter from them saying they couldn't repair, but they would ""offer"" me another pair for ""only"" $56.61..right? THAT was $25 MORE than what I had originally paid for these worthless things....so, I called Bushnell, once AGAIN....repeated my conversation originally with ""Travis""....the Bushnell rep tells me they found ""dirt and leaves"" inside the lens...ok...""WHAT""? We are not hunters...we are not campers...I know they don't know this...but honestly, neither of these two binocs had ever left my ""shoulder""....I am convinced they are not honoring their warranties...so...I'm out a pair of binnocs I've paid for twice, plus the $14 shipping....NEVER...NEVER buy these...don't know where the 3,4 or more ""star reviews"" come from...but this is an honest one!",https://www.amazon.com/Bushnell-131650-Powerview-16x50-Binocular/dp/B00000J6WY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1I40MFHIDGILJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.KNr0m1DOHyET_MBtqsSfLQ.E7-2DsB_O5eBWONpmwDZkqUQu1tm-l6McefvD41s1nY&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000J6WY&qid=1716327670&sprefix=b00000j6wy%2Caps%2C369&sr=8-1,2018

There was no inner protection to prevent each case from smashing its neighbour as the package was flung from one end of the universe to the other, (where I live). Despite this, the music is amazing.

Tale of the Mummy,"“It’s not about treasure, it’s about history!”","January 21, 2018",3,"In a dig site of a no-name tomb, something is unleashed and three people go to pieces. The tomb is sealed again and decades later it is reopened by a team wearing hazmat suits. A hanging coffin is discovered along with a fancy necklace. The coffin is brought to London for all to see, except for the poor man who is killed for his eyes. After that, bodies begin to pile up at an alarming rate. Time is short. The evil mummy Talos must collect all of his body parts before the planets align. He accomplishes this goal as litter, a trail of rags, dirty old wrapping.

This movie is noted for wasting the considerable talents of Christopher Lee and Honor Blackman in fragmented scenes lasting but a few seconds each. Shelley Duvall shows up late to the massacre while Gerard Butler slips out early, probably glad to be out of it. The only one who appears to be having any fun is Sean Pertwee.

Defenders of the Faith,Very Nice Vinyl Record 30th Anniversary Legacy Edition,"September 3, 2018",4,"For my taste, this is the best Judas Priest record.

There is just a bit of distortion, raspiness, evident on Heavy Duty when crowd cheer comes in. For the money though, especially if you need a brand new copy, this is a great buy. You also get a digital download from Amazon that includes the album as well as their live performance from 1984 in Long Beach, some bonus live 20 tracks.

Molly Hatchet,Great Stuff Still Holds Its Own,"August 18, 2018",5,"Molly Hatchet’s first album, appropriately titled, Molly Hatchet is where it all began for the band. As far as I know, there’s only one or maybe two of these guys still alive and neither of them are in the current version of the band. Not caring about the politics or the behind the scenes mess, I like both versions and almost went to see the current band last weekend. I think they’re great and carry on the legacy very well. I’ve seen them live three times already and hold no grudges, no dog in that fight.

I picked up this CD years ago and played it then shelved it for a long time, so it was great to pull it out again. Many of the songs are classics and it was great to hear them again. Bounty Hunter, Gator Country, The Creeper and Dreams I’ll Never See are the most played nowadays but the others are still great as well.

Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a policeman who falls victim to the bureaucracy when he refuses to fire on a group of rioters, and finds himself in prison for a crime he is innocent of. He makes a break for freedom, only to be recaptured and become a contestant on a game show called ""The Running Man,"" which is a bloodthirsty farce of justice that has convicted felons running for their lives from so-called Stalkers, who are nothing but psychopaths that just happen to work for the government, all broadcast live on television for the ravenous fans. Joining him is Maria Conchita Alonso as the citizen that turned him in, and two revolutionaries played by Yaphet Kotto and Jim Brown. This was a film late in Schwarzenegger's career, so it makes use of some of his catchphrase lines such as ""I'll be back,"" and has the usual blend of violence and humor that his movies were known for. But, with Richard Dawson guest starring as the game show host who is responsible for sending men to their deaths at the hands of a pack of killers, it has a certain charm and is entertaining, if somewhat predictable.",https://www.amazon.com/Running-Man-VHS-Arnold-Schwarzenegger/dp/B00000JGEN/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2DCRL59VINJN0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.DgkouRp2bMnfp9MBWUHGZA.TXZVzZzbM__42YpRYPlfJ_BQSWCJLq2RyQokw0L3GbY&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000JGEN&qid=1716372870&sprefix=b00000jgen%2Caps%2C333&sr=8-1,2018
Playing By Heart [DVD],Brilliant Subplots With Fabulous Interwoven Ending -- Perfect for at home Movie Night,"November 22, 2018",5,"For the first half of this movie I thought I was watching numerous, independent storylines. Then the ending brought all these brilliant subplots together, creatively linking various foreshadowing comments and scenes into a holistic story.

I was enticed to watch this by the great collection of actors and actress (many of whom are seen before the peaks of their individual stardoms in this 1998 film) including Gillian Anderson Angelina Jolie, Jay Mohr, and Ryan Philippe. They are accompanied by Hollywood standouts Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn, Madeleine Stowe, and Dennis Quaid. And as a bonus, Jon Stewart has a significant role, showing that he is much more than a talk show host.

Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits,The Best Of Bob Dylan's Early Period,"February 28, 2018",5,"The first compilation album by Bob Dylan is the best way to indulge on his best classics whether it's acoustic or electric. The lead off track here is the same as Blonde On Blonde-""Rainy Day Women #12 & 35"", which is great for the party-goers. This is followed by three of Dylan's ""folk"" classics-""Blowin' In The Wind""; ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"" and ""It Ain't Me, Babe"". The crown-achieving ""Like A Rolling Stone"" is his greatest rock piece and the first song to break the two-minute barrier single-wise. The original acoustic ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" leads off the second half of this set before the Byrds electrified it and took it to the top as their maiden voyage single release and the title of their debut album from 1965 which was the same year Dylan himself went electric at the Newport Folk Festival with two albums under his belt such as Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited. Speaking of the former album, it not only gave us the song just mentioned but also ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" patterned after the Chuck Berry song ""Too Much Monkey Business"" which also serves as a stepping stone for Rap enthusiasts[Just kidding]. The second of three Blonde On Blonde songs here is ""I Want You"" with that never-ending guitar hook played by Nashville pro Wayne Moss. The song here previously released as a single only ""Positively 4th Street"", the follow-up to ""Rolling Stone"". Closing this first Dylan compilation album is the third song from Blonde On Blonde[and closing half of the first record of rock's first double album], ""Just Like A Woman"". Yes, every song on this album is a classic and yet most of these songs have widely been interpreted by many artists and even actors, i.e. William Shatner and Sebastian Cabot, the latter of whom had an album full of Bob Dylan songs in dramatic reading fashion. You could get more songs from the same period on his second greatest hits collection plus songs from the late '60s and early '70s. If you want a basic collection, this one is highly recommended and there would be no place that you're going to.",https://www.amazon.com/Bob-Dylans-Greatest-Hits-Dylan/dp/B00000J7SM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3DGJSOKU7IZSU&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1sqf0F1F_4oVBcQfLlS4Yw.m3YrRSja5d1egNnLWTf7pbV67g-30Rk0CM3GMgJFmY4&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000J7SM&qid=1716331326&sprefix=b00000j7sm%2Caps%2C359&sr=8-1,2018

There is enough going on here for any music fan. There are anthems, rock outs, solos, good bass, and competent drums. And while not all of it is quite as crazy or innovative as some people tend to exaggerate, it is still the exhilarating and profound album that it was back in the 60s. Not much has changed. Pop music is a lot worse. But this kind of creativity powers on.

Painkiller,The best metal album ever made,"October 27, 2018",5,"The title is a bold statement, but in my humble opinion it is true. No album in the realm of metal is better than this one. Rob Halford's voice is at its absolute peak (and he was 40 years old when this album was recorded!), the guitar-work is absolutely phenomenal, and the drumming is simply mind-blowing. There is literally not a bad song on this album, hell there isn't even a good song, they're all beyond fantastic.

Hell Patrol and All Guns Blazing are just pure anthems of metal, Metal Meltdown is fast and thrashy as hell, and Leather Rebel is just such a fun song to listen to with it's rebellious spirit. A Touch of Evil is easily one of the best songs the band ever made, it has such a mysterious and evil vibe to it that you can't help but just bask in. The high notes that Rob hit towards the bridge to this song are simply mind-blowing. And then of course you have the epics Between the Hammer and the Anvil and Battle Hymn/One Shot at Glory, the latter song being my personal favorite Priest song. Overall, if you want to start someone out in the world of metal, or if you somehow haven't heard this album before, get this. It will seriously change your life.",https://www.amazon.com/Painkiller-Judas-Priest/dp/B0000027F3/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1Q9M6UKQTEES5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.a4e3ZhlDOTTWAQcxfeFJxA.Qp8LxrwVOeStVq292mXc7GkWsPk0ZdpJYfI4OHwYgw0&dib_tag=se&keywords=B0000027F3&qid=1716315182&sprefix=b0000027f3%2Caps%2C195&sr=8-1,2018

Guilty,Truly a Guily Pleasure,"November 16, 2018",5,"Guilty was one of those albums that captured a special, if not, bittersweet, time in my life. Oh to be young and carefree, but subject to the pain that comes along with growing up. I was going through my Barbra phase, and her connection with the Bee Gees didn't hurt. This was one of my LPs on which there were so many good cuts; but, as I'm sure many of you have, one where you dropped the needle when needed. The title cut is so soulful. If I was a radio personality on an Old School R&B station, I'd have slip this one in and hope the music director didn't ding me for playing Barbra Streisand on a 'black' station. But, the cut was totally blue-eyed soul. Without giving you a cut by cut review of every selection on the album, I will say, the song that holds the deepest memory is 'The Love Inside'. I won't bore you with the events that lead to my returning home from a co-workers gathering where my heart my broken by the realization that 'it just wasn't gonna happen' because they brought someone else to the party... other than to say, I played this cut over and over and over.... and cried uncontrollably, until my brother came out of his bedroom (where he left his girlfriend) to ask me, ""What the hell's wrong with you?"" LOL... now. But, to this day, that song, while it doesn't register the same emotions of that night, still makes me stop and sigh. I'm sorry if I can't break down each cut on Guilty. But, listening to this classic is, after all this time, a guilty pleasure to me. Young people... meet Miss Barbra. She is, like butter.",https://www.amazon.com/Guilty-Barbra-Streisand/dp/B0000025JT/ref=sr_1_1?crid=7QGAWAK75BJT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bWJFLK_6qT8yvopu7WBjLA.-K9xHZKK8vf9Ja04M1RhO5jFccd2h3qGUxUuiJfzsf8&dib_tag=se&keywords=B0000025JT&qid=1716307277&sprefix=b0000025jt%2Caps%2C368&sr=8-1,2018

Alice in Wonderland (Disney Gold Classic Collection),"Alice In Wonderland....not really my cup of tea, but my kids liked it!","January 18, 2018",3,"I have a daughter who is curious about the Alice In Wonderland story & characters, so I thought this would be a good movie for us all to watch on family movie night. The DVDs themselves were in brand new perfect condition & played perfectly on our DVD/Blueray player, but the movie itself was not really one I could say I liked, the story itself was rather strange. I just don't understand what makes it such a classic since it doesn't really have much of a story itself...it just seems like a weird pointless dream Alice has & not really much else, but then again, I had never read the book Alice In Wonderland either, so maybe if I had read it before watching the movie, that might have made more sense to me, but I'm not so sure I want to...the way the characters interacted most of the time with each other in this movie seemed rather rude & negative. On the plus side, the movie itself was colorful, bright & clear as was the sound, and it kept both of my daughter's attention. There were some scenes in the movie they found amusing & made them laugh... they seemed to enjoy it, so that was good... they liked the characters of the Cheshire Cat & the White Rabbit best. I am giving it 3 stars because while I didn't really care for this particular movie, it kept my kids entertained & the DVDs themselves played perfectly. I am considering getting the movie version of AIW starring Johnny Depp....I really like him as an actor & maybe that one will be more enjoyable for me....although I will have to watch it first before I decide whether I will have my daughters watch it.",https://www.amazon.com/Alice-Wonderland-Disney-Classic-Collection/dp/B00004R99L/ref=sr_1_1?crid=THXS0JTIZ264&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.5nJxQaLOU6MKzQQcUG_OFA.lfx8gkFCJt7Y5HY3rr0Wsq2mZluEu_CjeLnwVkJqQWs&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00004R99L&qid=1716405895&sprefix=b00004r99l%2Caps%2C362&sr=8-1,2018

Robin Hood (Disney Gold Classic Collection),"Wins Again- Emotional, Dramatic, Inventive and Interesting","August 8, 2019",4,"If you ever wondered where the cultural phenomenon of the Rocky movies originated, Stallone makes it irreversibly clear with this stylish and charismatic film. Stallone's talent is staggering yet very easy to underestimate somehow as it becomes lost in the wholeness of the overwhelmingly entertaining and engagingly inspirational series. Stallone proves his worth as a Director once again and shows a lot of range with his well developed and extremely nuanced cast performances, which is the sign of great directing every time. Stallone manages to act, direct and pen this film with characteristic humor and depth while allowing us to glide through the preamble before a rousing end fight with predictable yet evocative results. It feels like a smaller film than some of the others but also more humanistic and sensitive. The missing performance of Talia Shire, the central character in Rocky's life 'Adrian' from the other films is delicately balanced though does provide us with a deficit in the expanse of the overall film. The impressive performance by real life boxer Antonio Tarver makes the action of the movie extraordinary and provides us with a quality in the opposition of Balboa which is unparalleled in other movies, even from Rocky V which featured a real life boxer performance which was quite good. This is a rich film with plenty to deal with and it will leave you with a kernel of wisdom, will get your motor going with its eliciting of high energy emotions and it will get you interested in the plot which never stops developing.
A testament to the greatness of Stallone from which you can say he is truly someone who has earned his place in film history and as a cultural icon, whatever you may feel about him otherwise.",https://www.amazon.com/Robin-Hood-Disney-Classic-Collection/dp/B00004R99Q/ref=sr_1_1?crid=6M5HSA6LVN5K&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.E6JUSuulmP3zj9P1P3e_lQ.3zfyZScBzgkSJGgJQMFsoaFV2a7gv1DhSWPA2eVVb8I&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00004R99Q&qid=1716394422&sprefix=b00004r99q%2Caps%2C359&sr=8-1,2019

It went something lie this...""PAALEEEZ!!!""....But I saw all this critical acclaim and got curious-how could this possible not be another tired out money scheme? Well, I got my answer-Stallone's acting directing and screen play had truly graduated to a new level. This is film making at it's finest. This, like the original Rocky will bring a tear to your eyes and make the hair on your arm stand up. Like the original it will inspire you to take the hits and get up off the canvas in whatever your fight is in life. Is that a bit cheesy and over the top?

Perfect Blue [DVD],It's a Blue World,"March 29, 2019",5,"PERFECT BLUE predicted our everyday lives over twenty years ago -- it takes place in a world where privacy is unknown, social media exists to manipulate its users, fantasy and reality are intertwined to the point that one is as terrifying as the other, and where people exhibiting signs of PTSD are just part of the background. The late Satoshi Kon's 1997 animated thriller makes its viewers as uncertain of what's real and what isn't as its victimized heroine, ending the story with a wink that dares us to believe there's any such thing as a ""normal"" to get back to.

This is more like a Brian De Palma movie than your typical anime, and the irony of its re-release by GKIDS (a distributor better known for the Studio Ghibli Collection) is as freaky as PERFECT BLUE itself: what with the nudity, film-within-a-film rape scenes, and death by icepick, this ain't no kids' movie.

"Lello 4080 Musso Lussino 1.5-Quart Ice Cream Maker, Stainless - 110/120V 60 HZ",I would give it 6 stars if I could,"December 4, 2019",5,"The machine arrived all ready to go. I put in on the counter (fits fine, the footprint is well-thought-out by the manufacturer), wiped out the bowl and quickly washed (with a little soapy water) the blade, nut, cover, and spoon ... this took all of 5 minutes maybe. I had already researched my recipes, I need low-fat, lactose-free, calorie-restricted treats, and following the manufacturer's on-line pdf version of the manual I came up with this:

Two cups Fairlife Skim Milk (lactose free and low sugar) plus 3/4 cup organic Vermont maple syrup (purchased at a local discount store on the cheap). Poured one on top of the other in to a 4-cup measuring cup and put in the fridge so it wouldn't warm up in the kitchen (the milk and maple syrup were already in the fridge, of course) -- no mixing, no prep whatsoever, and turned on the machine's chiller for 15 minutes (set the timer to 45 minutes) as suggested by reviewers here and by the genius at icecreamscience<dot>com. After Alexa told me the 15 minutes were up, I dumped the contents of the measuring cup in to the bowl, turned on the churner, and told Alexa to alert me in 17 minutes and 30 seconds, again following icecreamscience.

When that period ended, I turned off the chiller for a few minutes as recommended by the manufacturer, then turned off the churner and served. We got FIVE nice portions of a smooth, creamy maple-flavored treat, plenty sweet and VERY tasty/refreshing. Everyone loved it.

I very carefully worked out the calories: 156 calories per serving. This is amazing. Yes, it's ""ice milk"", not ice cream, but it is wonderful. No additives, no fillers, ZERO work. One pour from each of two containers in to one measuring cup, that's it. And reasonably ""natural"", no?

Clean-up was a snap, following all the advice on Amazon. Use hot water, let the residue melt, protect the spindle opening, wipe up ... again, no more than 5 minutes, then hand-wash the lid, blade, nut, and spoon ... plus the measuring cup. Once again, just soapy water, super fast and easy. I plan to use a food-grade dairy-machine-oriented disinfectant (Amazon sells them in little packages and also in tablets) with a (glass) sprayer bottle maybe once a week.

In under an hour from the machine showing up at my door I was serving 4 people (and I had the 5th serving!) an amazing silky-smooth taste-great frozen treat with no lactose, virtually no fat, fully FODMAP-friendly, and as much control over the sugar as I could manage.

I am blown away. And should I need them, replacement covers, blades, etc. are available from the distributor in NJ. It doesn't get any better. I plan to move on to strawberry-based, pineapple-based, and coffee-based frozen treats, all with lower-calories in mind, now that I understand the basics. Lots of good advice on these ingredients in the manual.

Payback,Watch the theatrical release,"February 4, 2019",4,"The theatrical release of this movie would be on the list of what I would consider to be my “favorite” films. Being in the mood to watch it again, Prime or Netflix wasn’t offering it in their libraries (as of this writing, Prime is now showing the theatrical release. Yay!), so I jumped on Amazon to rent it. I discovered there was a directors cut. Wow, a chance to see one of my favorites, only better, because the director wasn’t being restricted by the stupid studio, right? Wrong! Way wrong! Watching both versions verifies two very import facets of filmmaking. 1) The film score is critically important. The score for the director’s cut is bland and in my opinion, detracts from the film. The theatrical release, which is decidedly noir, has a very supportive score, which punctuates the dark humor. 2) Studios know what sells. If you are a budding film critic or a full-time film student, you’ll love the director’s cut. However, everyone else will frickin’ hate it, compared to theatrical release. Why? Because the theatrical release is more ENTERTAINING, whereas the director’s cut is “dark and raw.” Guess what film critics? We ALL get a dose of reality every day and for many of us, it’s DARK and RAW. We don’t want to see a mirror of our troubled lives—we want to take a short break from it and be ENTERTAINED.

Robin Hood (Disney Gold Classic Collection),You Can't Go Home Again,"August 17, 2019",3,"The first Rocky movie captured lightning in a bottle and they've been trying to recreate it since; to no avail. I feel bad for younger generations who will never be able to experience what it was like to see the first Rocky in the theater in 1976. The excitement that built during the fight scenes was palpable and had had a theater full of white people yelling and cheering. There was thunderous applause at the end of the movie. It was a stirring experience.

I see what this film is trying to do and be. I appreciate the message. But the fight scenes were too obviously fake (meaning I could tell the young guy was holding back, and it was obvious how slow Stallone was). And sadly, I spent a lot of the movie wondering what was going on with Stallone's eyebrows and hair. I never saw Rocky V, but to hear he was basically brain damaged in it, and to have it followed up with this with no explanation is...well, I can only shake my head.

Mary Poppins [VHS],An absolute joy!,"May 29, 2019",5,"Our family is lucky in that our 2 year-old daughter loves such a wide variety of movies, and not just the standard cartoon fare.

She loves it so much, she has already asked to be Jane Banks for Halloween (5 months from now!). The movie is an absolute joy, and looks even better than I remember as a kid thanks to the high definition blu-ray image quality and sound.

An amazing added bonus is the digital copy that comes with the disc. With it, we were able to download the movie to our Amazon Fire for watching offline on long car rides.

The Running Man [VHS],Full of classic characters,"September 2, 2019",5,"Who needs a deep plot and special effects from an 80's sci-fi/action and borderline comedy? It has freakin' Richard Dawson and Jesse the Body Ventura in it!!! It's full of cheesy one liners and great character acting and great comical moments like ""Climbing for Dollars"" and ""Captain Freedom's Workout"" scenes. Did I mention there's women in leotards too? That NEVER hurts a thing!!! I can see why younger people wouldn't like it but anyone from the 80's generation surely recognizes this movie as a classic of the era. Anyway, the special effects suffice for the level of film this is. It's not going for anything mind bending. As I mentioned in my headline, the characters truly make this movie standout. If for some reason you missed this one growing up, definitely check it out. If you were born in my decade I'd probably slap you for not having seen it at least once. I delighted seeing it again. Yeah, it's fairly predictable but I don't care at all. Long live Richard Dawson!!! He did a standup job in this. It's not like it was hard for his acting to stand out here :) He nailed it.

Riddle Box,A satisfying remaster that needed to happen.,"February 15, 2019",5,"Riddle Box has always been a great album, but the production has always been sub par. Even 10 years ago when I didn't know much about music production or have a good ear, I noticed that the two albums before this sounded better.
Thankfully, it has finally been remastered and it sounds glorious. The bass and low tones are fuller, the samples are clearer, the vocals have been improved and it finally sounds closer to Great Milenko and less like The Terror Wheel.
Unfortunately, these sold out quick and now you have to pay a pretty penny. Originally priced at $30, I've seen some go for $80 and there is currently one listed for $750!
If you have the money or find a reasonably priced version, get it. It'll be worth every penny.

Talk about sanitizing in some family values, which is ironic given how hideously they twisted Hera’s *actual* mythological son - Hades).

Taming of the Shrew -DVD,I thought Elizabeth Taylor was supposed to be a GOOD actor!,"January 22, 2020",1,"My son is taking a Shakespeare course, and we've been watching a number of movies from Shakespeare plays. Neither of us had seen a production of Taming of the Shrew. I picked this film because of the famous actors and famous director. Both my son and I hated this production! Elizabeth Taylor's Katharina was more like a violently insane person. Richard Burton's Petruchio was a hedonistic, sexist ass (yes, I realize that's just part of how Shakespeare wrote the character) with completely unrealistic reactions to Katharina's lunacy and violence. I mean, this is supposed to be one of Shakespeare's comedies. But I would say this production was tragic. And, if this was a fair representation of Elizabeth Taylor's and Richard Burton's acting chops, then I have absolutely no idea why they were such lauded and sought after actors in their time. Ugh.

Brave New World,Pretty good,"April 27, 2020",4,"Been listening to Styx since HS, and they have pretty much been one of my favorite bands since. I own most their stuff, and pretty much love it all. Of course, their best stuff is from Equinox to Paradise Theater, but those were a unique times in life too, with growing up and all. I listened to their music with my friends, but even more while I was reading scifi novels. They are basically part of the landscape of all the books I read. So the memories of Styx, and other bands back then, are tied to me more than most music I picked up over the years. They really do have a unique spot in my life.

With all that said, Brave New World pretty much fits in with my idea of what Styx is. Just need to give it a go and a chance. I had to be reeled in a bit, and listen to it some, which is pretty normal for most music I like, but once I did, it definitely felt, and sounded like a Styx album. And sadly, the last one from the line up we all know so well. I look at it as a parting gift from them, and its not a bad send off at all. So no, I can't put it up there with my top era, but I can definitely add it to my collection and enjoy it on it's own. I think the whole album is pretty good, however, i have to say I could have done without 'High Crimes & Misdemeanors'. That song should be stricken from the record.",https://www.amazon.com/Brave-New-World-Styx/dp/B00000JG4W/ref=sr_1_1?crid=6DHTQ3M8J4AK&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.umHEUjJKr6KsRPUv0M__zw.0Vqqn10UUveYquGclWCX9K7nyd0bmYY6SwdOAnXoobU&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000JG4W&qid=1716372132&sprefix=b00000jg4w%2Caps%2C349&sr=8-1,2020

Turbo,The peak of 80s heavy metal sound,"June 14, 2020",5,"A good portion of heavy metal fans will criticize this album for sounding ""too commercial,"" but I personally love the sound and aesthetic of this album. Yes, this album is pretty much the 1980s summarized in 40 minutes, and there is a certain cheesiness to it, but if you love 80s metal, I think this is the peak of that era. There is no shortage of chorus effects and synthesizers here. At the same time, Turbo still remains distinctly Judas Priest. Yes they succumbed to the trends somewhat, but they were pretty faithful to the heavy metal genre nonetheless. I think this album is a lot of fun, sounds decent, and includes a couple of nice bonus tracks. I think if you're a lover of both 1980s culture and heavy metal music, you should have no problem enjoying this.",https://www.amazon.com/Turbo-Judas-Priest/dp/B000002657/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3BGIFCD4QMAC9&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4Lt9lOZW6aLzDYaucPf8Jg.ydzZskQEsB62kEq0d3GVh20YhkOdAutQf0Y7_zLvKfU&dib_tag=se&keywords=B000002657&qid=1716312347&sprefix=b000002657%2Caps%2C399&sr=8-1,2020

The case is beautiful and by far my favorite things are the Blu-Ray and DVD discs. I grabbed the Blu-Ray, and popped it into the Blu-Ray player. The menu is somewhat boring and simple, but most Blu-Rays are like that. It started up right away and played with no issues what so ever.

The heaviest ""super-duper-heavy-duty"" product I've ever ordered. It's kind of hard to use the smaller tape size but that's just me. I don't currently have a big tape roll in, because this is just for my home. I wanted a big heavy tape dispenser though and this definitely fits the bill! Perfect paper weight or anything else that could use some weight. IDK, with how increasingly cheap products are being degraded (especially skimping on the quality of materials but keeping the outer appearance the same), to find something that advetises itself as super heavy and then is *actually* as super heavy I hoped...it's nice. (However, the weight of this product may also change in the future, so note the date of this review.)

I like the additional cup holder thingy. With how big and heavy this is, therefore staying in one spot, it's convenient. As I now have ""The Place"" to put my favorite pens and scissors and such, all the things that I keep meaning to put in the same place, but constantly use and then misplace. I keep my scissors where the big tape roll is supposed to go lol. I just gotta be careful of the sharp edges where the tape is torn off. They are nice and sharp by the way!

This is likely not a very helpful review to most prospective buyers, but oh well. I do believe the other positive reviews, for what it's worth. I think this would work great in a work environment.",https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CT3WGX6?pd_rd_i=B07CT3WGX6&pf_rd_p=2f0a8989-0b67-47e7-b61e-9e3ef9908602&pf_rd_r=EZKZ9JJVBTVTR3E9Z6F4&pd_rd_wg=tVs7G&pd_rd_w=EUPSL&pd_rd_r=a86dd523-d4e9-46b5-8b39-0342d21c7098&th=1,2020

Perfect Blue [DVD],ANOTHER SATOSHI KON MASTERPIECE,"March 21, 2020",5,"You know you've entered a powerful world when you suddenly realize you've forgotten that what you're watching is nothing but ink and paint. But, oh my god, what this master of animation does with mere ink and paint is absolutely breathtaking. At first, you believe you're watching just some silly, brainless, pop-culture fluff. And, yes, it is showing you what that culture is like. But almost at the same moment, you become aware of a deep, very dark and twisted level of human depravity and pain.

The strangest part of this film is that the director/writer makes you feel sympathy with the worst of the characters he draws for you. Not at first, of course. At first, you are thoroughly repulsed and sickened by these people. But slowly, as you watch what they do and how and why they think as they do, you cannot help but feel a twinge of compassion. They are just as much victims of an ugly, twisted system as those who are openly exploited.

I was under the mistaken belief that this turned out to be the last film made by Satoshi Kon, the creator who made Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers, besides other impressive films. In fact, Millennium Actress, from 2019(?), was, I believe, his last film. These all are outstanding works of art, not just ""cartoons"". You get the feeling with his work that had he the funds, he would certainly have made live-action versions of his stories. But, budgets being what they are, he had to settle for anime. Still, his work is just as masterful and important as anything coming out of Ghibli. It's just a shame that this man had to die so young. I suspect we've been robbed of some truly unique and powerful films. Oh, well. That's life -- such as it is.

Again, I must emphasize that this film is rather deceptively simple. By the time you've gotten half-way through the story, you are absolutely hooked. Several times, I was rather surprised to realize that my mouth was open in shock at what I was seeing. The power of the sound and images he created is simply overwhelming. You quickly forget that you're watching a film; you are pulled, intellectually, emotionally, totally, into the story this man is telling. And even though the scenes you witness seem to be exploitative, the truth is that he is actually showing you exactly how the entertainment industry exploits the people it sucks into its web.

I'm certain he intended this to be an indictment of the Japanese entertainment industry. But we all know that the world-wide entertainment industry operates along the very same lines. In fact, truth be known, it is far, far worse than any of us suspect. Only recently have some brave individuals been able to come out publicly and reveal just how perverse this industry truly is. Yes, we have whistle-blowers in every industry. But the entertainment industry operates at a truly depraved level of exploitation only recently being revealed. Fascinating how this anime director, twenty-some years ago seemed to be one of the first to sound the alarm. Sad, of course, how no one was really listening.",https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Blue-Junko-Iwao/dp/B00000JL42/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3HSBCITO53ZR4&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.N2kFqWN-E9kfDqJAt7V2yQ.HDGkW32ft8qfB2n-JOTVJ2tqN2yOa0CdwoBVrQmgj44&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000JL42&qid=1716379434&sprefix=b00000jl42%2Caps%2C343&sr=8-1,2020

"Lello 4080 Musso Lussino 1.5-Quart Ice Cream Maker, Stainless - 110/120V 60 HZ",Lello 4080 Musso Lussino 1.5-Quart Ice Cream Maker Follow up review,"September 5, 2020",5,"I purchased this machine about 4 weeks ago. My previous ice cream machine was one I purchased from Sur le Table. It appeared to have been a generic machine. Don't recall the manufacturer. It worked ok and stimulated my interest in making frozen deserts.

One of my concerns regarding the Lello 4080 was cleaning the bowl since the stainless steel bowl is not removable. Apparently this enhances the freezing of it's contents. Actually it's not too bad to clean. Just wipe it out a few times and you are done. I have some concern about getting liguid down into the mechanism through the spindle so I leave the paddle on until the last. It's a bit harder to clean but seems safer to me.

I have made 4 batches of ice cream and it works beautifully. The ice crystals must be smaller because the product is very smoothe . The maximum amount of custard is 900 ml. I don't know what the final volume is but I think it may be a little less than 1 1/2 quart.

Surprised there is no temperature readout on the thing but I guess it is not to know the temperature but rather go by what the ice cream looks like.

So far I am 100% pleased with the Lello 4080. I suggest adding about 3 tablespoons of vodka or liqueur to the recipe to keep the ice cream from hardening when you place it in the freezer. There is a difference! I am not sure what makes this machine so good. Maybe it's the rotation speed or the cooling element or possibly the paddle.

I would recommend it. Expensive but hopefully you will not need more than 1! I did get the Asurian warranty offered on Amazon. The price on Amazon is good. An Italian supplier asked $799. on Ebay and would not budge.

Enjoy our ice cream!

Follow-up
I have been using this machine for over a year with good results. After reading other reviews I guess you either get a good one or a bad one. Fortunately for me I received one that works perfectly. I still suggest care in cleaning so that contents don't get into the works through the spindle. A small balloon over the spindle might help! Another suggestion is that you completely clean out the contents or let it melt completely before starting another batch. I had some extra from a previous batch and thought I could just dump it in. The machine made some terrible noises from the gear box when it encountered the frozen part at the bottom. I thought I had killed it but is still working fine. Amazon sells Asurion warranty which I purchased. I had a warranty issue with a dishwasher and Asurion was very difficult to work with. Finally got it deemed unrepairable and received a refund but was without a dishwasher for 2 months. Up to you! Adding some Vodka or flavored liquor will help keep the ice cream soft in the freezer. Maximum of 3T vodka per quart. This machine works fast and makes fine ice cream. If you are serious about ice cream I think this machine is for you. Hope you get one of the good ones.

"Officemate Heavy Duty Weighted 2-in-1 Tape Dispenser, Recycled,Black (96660)",Totally 5 Stars!,"March 30, 2020",5,"It seems like a full five-star review is too good to be true, but not with this product! It's 100% true. My dad and I opened an eBay store recently and make multiple trips to the post office with about 5-20 packages daily; needless to say we go through a lot of packing tape. My dad uses the 3m tape dispensers and he does okay with them after using them for over 10 years in his retail experience but NOT me. Those things hate me! The tape always comes out sideways on the roll causing it to tangle and twist when I really need it not too! Now shipping labels are my primary focus and I can very easily pullout even long pieces of packing tape and they come out perfect and cut very easily! Using the small tape dispenser has been a breeze as well; having them side by side has completely changed the shipping game!

I was hesitant because in some of the reviews it showed the circular rings that hold the tape in place popped out, but once locked in place those puppies don't come out! They hold very sturdy and allow for easy pulling and tearing. The base of the dispenser is very heavy and sturdy, I believe it weighs almost 6 lbs. total. It also includes rubber feet in each corner plus a rubber pad on the bottom which prevents any sliding while taping.

If I could order 50 more of these I would!! So worth it for the price point! You'll also save more $$ by using less tape because it's much easier to take out the amount of tape needed for each package!

Sorry for the long review, I just love giving info. :-)",https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CT3WGX6?pd_rd_i=B07CT3WGX6&pf_rd_p=2f0a8989-0b67-47e7-b61e-9e3ef9908602&pf_rd_r=EZKZ9JJVBTVTR3E9Z6F4&pd_rd_wg=tVs7G&pd_rd_w=EUPSL&pd_rd_r=a86dd523-d4e9-46b5-8b39-0342d21c7098&th=1,2020

Safe As Milk,It is Faux Twenty and a Splendid Time is Guaranteed for All,"April 4, 2020",4,"This is the best early CB&tMB. The music is better now than when it was first recorded and released. How is that possible?

The band was prime then and very advanced considering their contemporaries. This group acted upon their vision and talents to pursue their vision. Many of their contemporaries were, in essence, reacting to the time, the scene, and the perceptions and prejudices of 1960s society. This makes the Captain and this version of the Magic Band nearly timeless, which in turn makes them still relevant.

The music is both ancient (e.g., blues-based) and forward-looking, at the same time. They were ahead of their time by being based in the past and the future at the same time. Soon, The Captain and the Magic would morph and mutate into the Piscean-faced Verisimilitude. They would literally take a giant step outside their collective mind.

This particular version of the endlessly fascinating album (now on CD) is an incredibly-priced bargain. The original tracks are rendered in pristine 'Back to Mono'. Just as John Lennon advocated. Ry Cooder sounds magnificent. Drumbo is masterful. The bass guitar figures are truly psychedelic, rather than the usual (for this time period) stereotypical hippie-trippy claptrap. The Cap'n writes, sings, growls and plays various non-rock instruments in his distinct and unique style, which moves his vision ever forward. Not bad for over fifty years ago.

The extra tracks are truly a bonus grab bag of titles gleaned from the Mirror-Man sessions, etc. These items are in stereo and vary from a B-side release to standard length demos and unused takes. Included on this disc are two hallucinogenic titles sporting mini-opus recording lengths. Wow!

If you have even a passing fancy in a midnite dream for this music, these musicians, or the time period, then swallow a full dose of this concoction. After all, It IS 'Safe as Milk'.",https://www.amazon.com/Safe-Milk-Captain-Beefheart-Magic/dp/B00000J7A2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3OB4RSYYT10Z6&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.0oUC8ESrocopMENWxmmQrQ.UO76G8chO-UYZsHJOnMj5WeYPQMCxHmJEUVvUp1pOfU&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000J7A2&qid=1716328411&sprefix=b00000j7a2%2Caps%2C365&sr=8-1,2020

At first the British accent may be a little hard to understand...but hang in there. I got this to watch with my 7 and 9 year old. I had to set the story up for them at first because they weren’t used to the accent. When Kate was throwing her fits they just laughed and laughed.

King Cobra [DVD],It's a movie about a giant rattle/cobra snake,"November 21, 2020",4,"This movie is a huge pile of nostalgia for me. It was shown often as a creature feature before it was a thing on cable tv. I love it as a child bc it delivered on having a giant snake that killed ppl. As it happens, I also saw Anaconda on theaters. I think this movie is better. Anaconda (before being beloved for the ball of crap that it is) was promoted as this amazing movie with a glowing cast and budget. It's the movie that paid five million dollars to JLo. At that time it was unheard for a Latina to make that kind of money and to start in a huge horror/action movie. It was like jungle Alien...not. King Cobra was a modest straight to video flick with no pretensions. It doesn't take itself seriously. It looks bad because its cheap. It's poorly written because it was developed fast. Nonetheless, it's a super fun movie that contains stereotypical cholos, stereotypical bad 90's music, stereotypical rednecks, impossibly ridiculous science, a mad scientist, cheese drama, cheese romance, and Eric Estrada failing at being a gay stereotype. On top of that a top performance from a vicious giant snake. You can see the contempt it was for humanity on its penetrating gaze! The thing seems way smarter than the team of heroes that includes a no nonsense cop, two scientists and a hot shot doctor. What is not to love of this movie?",https://www.amazon.com/King-Cobra-Hoyt-Axton/dp/B00000JGLB/ref=sr_1_1?crid=36JN66HCOTPDK&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.x-RPVqUmrjk9j3FZgsxcCQ.o9eZBCB5vXeuhXwOi-1IcOCy3O7E9gRcUQuBbmiZn7w&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000JGLB&qid=1716374457&sprefix=b00000jglb%2Caps%2C206&sr=8-1,2020

Songs About Jane,The Ultimate In Pressing!,"June 20, 2020",5,"I almost have forgotten the sound from a good pressing, and on black vinyl to boot. The record is absolutely flat. There are no detectable surface noises. Especially appreciated when playing at a higher volume level. It was so clear, that for moment, I thought I was listening to a CD. I didn't detect any distortion on the inner tracks.

Now, if we could only stay away from colored and picture discs. Record manufacturers attempted this back in the 1970's. Why repeat the process. It was undesirable for sound reproduction back then. Why attempt to bring it back?

In conclusion, I like this album. I don't have to worry about playing it in front of children with virgin ears. I was excited to learn that the song ""Secret"" was on it.

Barbara Stanwyck is a wonderful actress but the character she plays in the film lies to her boss, lies to the public and is willing to marry a man she doesn't love to advance her career.

This is the album Chess wanted to make with Muddy Waters, instead of ""Electric Mud"", to market him to the hippies(after rebranding him a folk singer, another fad).

I'm almost positive that many who watched this film, DID NOT truly understand the Positive Messages, and Motivation expressed.

Very FEW movie (the past decade plus) hit THAT nerve... get your heart pumping, with a joyful tear in your eye.

Perfect Blue [DVD],Even better than I expected,"January 10, 2020",5,"Anime reviewers always bring up Satoshi Kon's work when talking about their favorite movies. I finally had the chance to watch one of his works, and boy am I glad I did.

Mima is a pop idol who has decided to shift careers into being an actress. Starting out on a seedy tv drama, she is pushed to do some sketchy scenes to advance her career. Her stress is compounded by a website she finds online that seems to be run by a stalker. Over time, the stress of both of these things causes her to lose her grip on who she is and what is actually going on in her life. If you've ever watched Black Swan, it's quite similar to that.

The animation direction is stunningly good in this movie. Despite the dated art style, the use of cuts brings out the insanity in what Mina is going through, and the body language given to every character is nearly indistinguishable from live action.

I'm Glad You're Here With Me Tonight,Timeless Classic,"February 20, 2020",5,"Decades ago, I lived with my oldest brother when I first listened to this amazing album. I can't count the number of times we both air-guitared our way through Lament in D Minor/Sabre Dance on hot August nights. It is an inspired, joyful piece of music. Since that time, my brother left us, and I eventually threw out all of my record albums when I thought that albums would never be around again. Now records have made a comeback. So, I bought a really good turntable. I knew I had to buy this album again to relive those moments in the basement of my brother's house, because only music has that way of playing back scenes of a life. Music really is the soundtrack to our lives. The music of this album, and that song in particular, are as powerful today as they ever were. I bought the album for the music and the moments they evoke. And I can play back those moments whenever I want, when the needle lands with such grace and precision on the record grooves.

Hercules (Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection),Great Retelling of a Classic Tale,"October 8, 2020",5,"Disney's ""Hercules"" is an upbeat rendition of the classic myth. It tells the simple story of an immortal being trying to find the place where he belongs. Sterling performances by Danny DeVito who plays Hercules' satyr trainer Philoctetes (Phil) and Susan Egan as Megara (Meg) his wise-talking love interest. James Woods voices the god Hades, the villain of the piece who comes across like a ruthless executive, making shady deals with everyone and hoping no one sees the fine print. The songs are top notch, sung by the muses who tell the story and interact with the characters. Parents might want to familiarize their kids with the original myth so they can understand the film as it is full of classical references which will go over the head of the average child (the muses aren't going to explain everything).
The film has been panned by religious types who take offense at everything. Incredibly, it has also been panned by the Greek Government who think we Yankees have no right tampering with their cultural past--even though they no longer worship that cultural past. These two negative attitudes simply prove that conservatism is the root of all anal and cause this reviewer to quote a line from the film: ""Lighten up, dude!""

Kid A,"Vanilla Sky, anyone?","March 19, 2020",5,"If you're familiar with the movie Vanilla Sky, or you're just a fan of space rock, than you'll be happy to find that this is an astounding album to own and have. For an album that's been released for more than 20 years, this album continues to sound good, and stand to the test of time. This is a reissue of the album's release, all original pressing released literally 20 years ago, with some limited/collector's editions with later demands. If you're new to radiohead, I'd suggest giving this a listen, or OK Computer.

Overall: Though kind of kind of expensive, you're getting 2 12 inch LP's, both black, with pictured sleeves. This also includes a downloadable version of this album, and a quality case, as Radiohead records tend to be. The spine is thick/wide, as well. Favorite tracks: Everything in its Right Place, Optimistic, and Idioteque.

Playing By Heart [DVD],American Style Love Stories,"November 29, 2020",5,"The is a movie about long-term and beginning ways that men and women love each other, in America. I say ""in America"" because it struck me that in many other countries marriage could be quite different; example, arranged marriages. I have been around for quite a while, and all of the stories reminded me of my relationships. I guess a movie is very successful if it arouses a lot of emotion in the person watching.
The cast was incredible, including many of the most desirable men and women of that time. The acting was exceptional and felt realistic. You cared about them. In a few scenes, unusual things happened, but I guess not too unlikely.

"Lello 4080 Musso Lussino 1.5-Quart Ice Cream Maker, Stainless - 110/120V 60 HZ",You get what you pay for!,"October 12, 2020",5,"yes it hurt to pay the price, but now it is done, i have no regrets, actually the whole family loves it.

One thing i never found info on that i figured out & works for me is this:
I premix my basic ice cream recipe into a quart sized jar, I use the quart size because as it freezes it increases its volume, and in the end, it fills my 1.5 quart containers i bought. I mix sugar, (cocoa powder if needed) half and half, 30% whipping cream and vanilla bean paste or just plain vanilla extract. I shake it up to mix and then its ready. i usually turn on the machine until the bowl is cold to the touch. maybe 5 - 10 minutes with the compressor running I then pour in the 1 quart jar of mix, turn on the mixing bar and let it rock...
since my cream and half and half live in the fridge they are already chilled so it doesn't take long to see it thicken. any extra ingredients like, coffee( I prefer fresh ground, not actual coffee), nuts or jam, or other last minute additions go in as it thickens.... and when it is stiffened up a bit it is basically soft serve at this point, ready for a party to use immediately, or, as I prefer put it in a good container and set into the freezer and let it set up! it can be made ahead of time, but it is fun to make while everyone is enjoying the main food course.
as for removing the ice cream, i bought a set of silicone spatulas and I like the broad kind that has a scoop shape to it, and remove as much as i can then remove the mixer bar, then finish the bowl as best you can.

To clean I usually sprinkle a little water to soften the residual ice cream frozen to the walls, then sop it up with paper towels and it usually comes clean. at his point, if i am making multiple batches, I re-engage the cooler and repeat the procedure.
although it is a substantial sized device we managed to tuck it into a corner and hardly know its there, but never is it forgotten, it is quick and easy to pull out and fire up and pull a single batch or multiple batches. and it opens up a whole world to explore, my journey has just begun.

its a great machine if you can budget it in you wont regret it, unless you are struggling with your weight... good luck on that. LOL
so far i have made:
Blueberry cheesecake
Blueberry
rocky road
coffee
peanut butter
pistachio
toasted almond with real maple syrup
I am planning:
irish cream
burbon
rum (goslings black seal) and ginger beer with lime.

and the list goes on...

all the best to you all",https://www.amazon.com/Lello-Musso-Lussino-1-5-Quart-Stainless/dp/B00004RDF0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31U03XBHKUMO5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iXlysYCg0z8XEdEPjHGk2kJC_fdcMEbmIRU8o4BjybTGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.ZMutt-h32Z9VEDOvq-w0r6OPQBIKqJP3M2dLoBEOKkY&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00004RDF0&qid=1716402056&sprefix=b00004rdf0%2Caps%2C198&sr=8-1,2020

Turbo,Fantastic,"February 4, 2020",5,"Under appreciated gem here with turbo. I love this album. It's filled with great songs if you just accept it's not going to sound like painkiller or stained class. It is what is. Turbo lover is the hardest driving song on here. The buildup to the chorus is fantastic with the guitar creeping in as the chorus approaches. Robs vocal is fantastic on that song and the entire record, considering this was his first record and tour sober, and it shows. Out in the cold is the groups best ballad IMO. The synth mixed with the heavy guitar is awesome. It sounds great on vinyl with some good mid range. Hot for love is great, the bit right before the chorus gets me every time. Obviously locked in is an awesome tune. Love that song. The synth at the beginning and the chorus is great with that one. Then there's reckless. That song stands out in it's own realm. Possibly the one song from this album that could have fit in proudly on any of their heavier more accepted albums. It contains possibly the heaviest, crunchiest, nastiest riff that they ever came up with throughout their entire discography. It sits within my top 5 favorite riffs of all time. The mastering on this album is great and is actually softer and less treble focused than the 30th anniversary release, which is good.

Christmas in Connecticut [VHS],Fast service and great outcomes,"November 8, 2020",5,"So as the years go on and the older I get, Christmas becomes more magical. This year I decided on November 1st I was going to start watching The Grinch every day. Then I thought, why stop at the Grinch?
My husband, sweet man, is like the Grinch. He hates the whole Christmas season. No one quite knows the reason. (I think it is because his head isn't screwed on just right)
Anyways he has been stuck watching all the Christmas classics with me everyday. This movie I did not have. So like the sneaky little elf that I am, I took his credit card and purchased this moving. (He hates old movies.)
The next day Christmas in Connecticut arrived. I went on about my day doing the typical stuff people do. Once we got ready for bed I popped the movie in and told him he was in for a real treat. BAM! Old black and white Christmas movie was playing!!! He immediately jumped out of bed, accused me of being an evil Christmas witch and I got the whole bed to myself...

Big Picture,Smitty's best album,"September 17, 2020",5,"This album was a revelation when it came out in 1986 because it was a highly artistic, professionally produced CCM album. It's different today—guys like Sufjan Stevens and the band Son Lux can be Christian and write artistic music that reflects their faith in a mainstream market. But back then, if it didn’t sound like adult contemporary, it wasn’t played on Christian radio stations. “The Big Picture” is still among what I consider the best CCM albums ever made during that period in the sense of purely artistic merit—and that’s a pretty short list: Mark Heard’s masterpiece, “The Dry Bones Dance” is one. Dylan’s “Slow Train Coming.” Phil Keaggy’s “Town to Town,” Chagall Guevera’s self-titled album, The 77s “Sticks and Stones.” There are others, but you get the idea. MWS has always been ""McCartney-esque"" in his ability to write incredibly catchy, hooky music, but he's not a lyricist. ""The Big Picture"" was the first time Smith teamed up with lyricist Wayne Kirkpatrick, and it was a brilliant pairing. He also got John Potoker to produce the album--who worked with Genesis, Madonna, Scritti Politti, etc. Suddenly, there was a Christian album that SOUNDED like the stuff on rock stations rather than adult contemporary music. Not only that, but the lyrics were full of metaphors--they were actually poetic! Now, 34 years later, I'm 56 years old, I still really love most of the songs on this album--Lamu, Wired for Sound, Rocketown, Voices, Goin' Thru the Motions, You're Alright--I'm still impressed with the lyrics and music. The music and production is similar to Genesis in the 80s--Abacab & Invisible Touch—synths, drum machines and bright distorted Fender guitars. My only complaint is that ""The Big Picture"" would really benefit from a remaster. But as I understand it, this was Smith’s least successful album, (and evidently the companies that own CCM masters from the 70s & 80s consider it such ephemera they won’t even release most of it as mp3s). So there’s not much hope of a remaster. His follow-up, ""I 2 Eye"" was much more CCM mainstream. By the time he released ""Go West Young Man,"" he and Kirkpatrick had shifted to the David Foster/Chicago power ballad sound, and he had a big mainstream hit with ""Place in this World"" (which sounds like it could've been in a Disney's ""Aladdin""). In my opinion, Smith never took the risks he took on ""The Big Picture"" ever again. He still made great music CCM--the guy's a genius--but as far as genuine artistry goes, this is his White Album.",https://www.amazon.com/Big-Picture-Michael-W-Smith/dp/B0000004R1/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2QK6XG763PYQ0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dtFjF_aKXfOeToUgvZ9kXA.PzJR4EnIy1hDVfWwcfii0WkVHFFcyI2uhzO_eSNkb6w&dib_tag=se&keywords=B0000004R1&qid=1716288118&sprefix=b0000004r1%2Caps%2C184&sr=8-1,2020

Perfect Blue [DVD],"A Refreshing, Dark, Mature Animation","June 18, 2020",4,"I've always felt that there is a startling lack of dark, mature stories in the animated world. It's been long since people realized that animation is not just a genre for kids. So while this movie is a little older it holds up well and it is highly recommended for those who like animation and want more nuanced, mature stories.

Not a voice that exuded power or intimidated, like KC's did. Lucy Liu got a few more minutes of screen time slapping Greg Henry around but they did cut her time attacking Mel Gibson and the mob thug in the SUV.

Live Alive,Not Really Live,"May 2, 2021",2,"First off let me add the disclaimer that I never heard this record. And I likely never will. Why?

Licensed To Ill,Meh,"September 6, 2021",2,"I'm a Beastie Boys fan, to be sure. I collected every last one of their albums before buying their debut. (I vaguely remembered it from childhood.) I decided to pick this up since it was only $5.00 and I needed to complete my collection. It's pretty rough. A couple catchy beats, but overall, nothing too memorable (except the radio hit, which I suppose is okay).

IMO Beastie Boys became much more interesting once they started saying something of substance. They also improved on their ability to create atmosphere by only the second album. They are definitely a fun (and thoughtful) ride from there on out.

"I, Jonathan",(Vinyl review) Bad pressing. Do not buy until Craft Recordings figures this out.,"January 27, 2021",1,"I love this album and when I saw Craft Recordings released it on vinyl I got very excited. I own several other Craft Recordings releases (Cheating at Solitaire by Mike Ness and Violent Femmes self titled) and they all sound fantastic. I, Jonathan however, has some serious issues. I have now purchased and returned this record 3 times from Amazon and other vendors because on the first track (Parties in the U.S.A.) there is a very audible crackling that occurs about halfway through the song. The crackling is mostly present on the peaks of Jonathan's vocals and continues intermittently throughout the rest of side 1. These artifacts occur in the exact same spots on all three records I purchased and is absent when comparing it to any of the digital versions. I Spincleaned all of them and it made little to no difference. Plus, all 3 records have a ton of vinyl shavings peeling off the razor-sharp unfinished edges. Such a shame because the rest of the record sounds great and is dead quiet with no warps etc. Hopefully Craft Recordings figures this out but until then I'm keeping my money. Another casualty of the modern vinyl quality fade.

Update: Per Discogs this record was pressed by Rainbow Records.

Whoops maybe I had the disc swapped, but looking at the other I realize no, it’s the exact same one, same label. Wait, maybe just the label is wrong. I proceed to look at the grooves and see clearly both sides of the discs match the other disc. I have two of the same disc. Just to make sure I put the other disc on, and to my complete annoyance, it’s the same.

The weird part is, I swear I played everything in it’s right place on this vinyl when I first got it. But that was a year ago, and it couldn’t be. So I thought well let me get another one, since there is no way to replace/return a vinyl order from a year ago. And of course you literally cannot buy this record anymore.

Heat [DVD],"5-Star Movie, but the ""Director's Definitive Edition"" Brings It Down","February 24, 2021",4,"Heat is one of the greatest movies of all time, bringing in two legendary actors playing characters who are two sides of the same coin - one a professional who takes down high-level scores and the other a homicide detective whose life is defined by the hunt for those types of criminals, but both suffering flaws and breakdowns due to their personal codes and the paths they've chosen. The rest of the cast is excellent, and the way the story plays out, with ebbs and flows and highs and lows, quiet contemplative scenes and ear-shattering gunfights, it just mesmerizes you.*

I can only give 4-stars for the newer blu-ray release though, because personally I found it to be a bit of a let down. Much like other redone releases, the clarity and sharpness are excellent, and there are some nice new features like a cast/crew interview by Christopher Nolan (no inclusion of the original tv movie ""LA Takedown"" though, which would have been nice). The problem is that Mann, like others, has re-color timed the movie, so a lot of it has a light blue hue and just looks weird. This is something that plagues a lot of releases (Terminator 2, Batman, Blade Runner, etc) and takes away from the experience. I'm also annoyed at the removal of the line ""viscous, aren't I?"", as now you just see Hank Azaria's face frozen for a few seconds and again, it feels out of place.

*Slight detractions in the cast include Diane Venora as Hanna's ex wife (pretentious to a fault) and Kevin Gage as Waingro, who just doesn't fit with any of Neil's crew or the rest of the characters.",https://www.amazon.com/Heat-Al-Pacino/dp/B00000JGHM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3SL469QP21XCV&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.PmNQQE0-VFN54RqcmvdUyg.3_j41rq4emamAewkfOH-l5Es6bm3KQ8RSlHawbxhCdU&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000JGHM&qid=1716373112&sprefix=b00000jghm%2Caps%2C196&sr=8-1,2021

Perfect Blue [DVD],Dark Psychological Thriller,"December 20, 2021",4,"An uncommon aspect I've noticed about those whose described the film rarely mention that it reveals the nature fo the exploitive aspect of the entertainment industry. Also more intersting is how the downward spiral of the main character's mental state also reveals that of how she influenced those around her. She is exploited of her own volition in ways she hates herself for doing so yet chose anyway. The tv show within the movie parallels the ongoing of the film's own story. Dark, twisted, disturbing, exploitive and also a commentary on the psychological cost of unbridled guilt chosen in a cruel industry. Great film but also not for the feint of heart, not for everyone.

Note: There were two 5-10 second occurences of repeated playback that seemed like it didn't belong and a breif quality drop for two occurences that lasted a few minutes each.

It also does what it was made to do, flawlessly - make ice cream. And not just ""ice cream"" - gelato, soft-serve, hard cream, frozen yogurt, sorbet - every type of frozen confection. And it does it in about 15 to 20 minutes, average.

Ice cream is, basically, a pretty simple confection - water/milk/cream, sugar, and other ""stuff."" Mixed together and frozen. The ""mix together"" and ""freezing"" parts are where it gets complicated. The mixing and freezing make all the difference in the mouth feel, texture, workability (scooping, plopping on your ice cream cone, plate or cup), consistency, and overall perceived ""quality"" of the ice cream. No one likes ice cream with big chunks of ice in it, or hard in one spot, soft in another, or a titanium brick when you try to scoop it. This machine makes perfectly consistent ice cream, batch after batch, ready to serve out of the machine, or to put in your freezer. It does this by rapid churning and rapid cooling, making the smallest crystals perfectly blended, resulting in an even, smooth blend of ingredients, chilled to the perfect stage of completion.

As far as the machine itself, in this age of Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity, digital readouts, iPhone and Android apps, it's an absolute evolutionary throwback. It has three controls - a twist dial 'click' timer (which doesn't go backwards - when you set it for 30 minutes, it will click down to 30 minutes until it stops), and two function buttons - one to turn on the churning blade and one to turn on the compressor (it's a compressor machine that chills internally - no freezing extra containers, no ice, no rock salt). That's it. The function of the timer is to power the buttons - when the timer is running, the buttons work. When the timer is off, pressing the buttons does nothing. The timer is actually probably redundant (there is no alarm), except as a reminder, or to make sure the machine is off when it stops, because you will be monitoring the final stages of your mix - ice cream mixes and freezes, as you probably know, at it's own pace - it's done when it's done, depending on a hundred variables, even with the same mix. You'll actually hear a change in the motor as the ice cream hardens, and the blades will move slower - in fact on this machine, when the ice cream is completely set, the blades will stop - time to take it out. For those who are particular about their ice cream and to reduce stress on the motor, most mixes are best removed when the mix reaches an optimum temp: 21F-23F (the ""draw"" temperature), which can be measured with a cheap IR thermometer. And I've never had a batch take more than 30 minutes, although I suppose there might be exotic ingredients that might take longer - but I can't imagine any mix taking the full 60 minute maximum on the timer. Adding ingredients at any time is as simple as lifting the plastic mixing cavity cover and dropping them in.

Cleanup is actually a breeze, in spite of the non-removable mixing cavity - it's all stainless. Just scoop out the ice cream, remove the blade by lifting out after unscrewing the retaining nut (you do need to cover the exposed blade shaft to prevent liquid getting inside - I did it with a simple rubber spacer), and remove the remaining ice cream. You then just wipe out the bowl with soapy water after it warms up slightly, rinse with a damp towel and dry. Finished. You learn not to be messy (with any ice cream machine), and minimize drips on counter or self.

The weak point of the machine is the 1 year warranty - and the cost. Well over $700, a 1 year warranty is nervous-making, although I don't know how many have had to use it - I consequently highly recommend Amazon's extended warranty, and I don't usually purchase add-on warranties. You may never need it (and likely won't - it's really an industrial quality build), but nice to have on such an expensive machine. The cost is worth it, to me, because I bought the machine to do one thing - make ice cream. And it does this superbly. Highly recommended.",https://www.amazon.com/Lello-Musso-Lussino-1-5-Quart-Stainless/dp/B00004RDF0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31U03XBHKUMO5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iXlysYCg0z8XEdEPjHGk2kJC_fdcMEbmIRU8o4BjybTGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.ZMutt-h32Z9VEDOvq-w0r6OPQBIKqJP3M2dLoBEOKkY&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00004RDF0&qid=1716402056&sprefix=b00004rdf0%2Caps%2C198&sr=8-1,2021

"Lello 4080 Musso Lussino 1.5-Quart Ice Cream Maker, Stainless - 110/120V 60 HZ",Worth Every Penny For Frequent User,"March 22, 2021",5,"Did a lot of research and read a lot of product reviews in my quest for an authentic Italian Gelato machine. I've had the old Cuisinart home ice cream machine in the past, where you freeze the bowl first, and I didn't want to deal with having to freeze the bowl again, I wanted a self-contained refrigerated unit, of which there are really only 3 of that I considered (this one, the Breville and the Cuisinart). There are cheap Chinese knock-offs that Amazon is pushing of course, just like every other product, and I refuse to buy any of that garbage. So despite the outrageous price I decided to give this one a shot primarily based upon the Italian manufacturing (not China) since I've had great luck with other Italian appliances. As noted in many other reviews, this unit is robust, heavy and powerful.

To clarify on a couple of the most common ""complaints"" from other reviews I read - here's my perspective:

1) CLAIM: It's heavy, so you need to find a place to park this an never move it. Hogwash! It weighs 38 lbs. not 138 lbs. I have it stored in my pantry and when I want to use it I grab it and set it on my kitchen counter right next to the sink, when I'm done I put it back in the pantry. Perhaps if you're not capable of carrying 38 lbs. a few feet then it would be an issue (elderly, weak body type, etc.) but I'd say for most people it's not going to be an issue. My wife can carry it no problem.

2) CLAIM: It doesn't have a removable bowl so it's hard to clean. Hogwash! This is probably the easiest to clean appliance I own. The entire thing is stainless steel and the bowl and top are highly polished stainless steel, it doesn't get any easier to clean than that. Here's what I do to clean it. Make gelato. Scoop gelato out with a silicone spatula, leaving very little in the bowl. Leave the unit turned off and just sit for 10 minutes to let the bowl unfreeze. Take a paper towel and wipe out what's left. Wet another paper towel and wipe the bowl out. Take a dry paper towel and do a final wipe of the bowl. It literally takes 30 seconds to clean this and it looks brand new every time. Just don't try to clean it immediately when the bowl is still frozen, let it melt and then it's a piece of cake.

NOTE: You DO need to be careful when removing the blade to not get the threads of the bolt that holds the blade on full of gelato since it would be difficult to fully clean that off.

I don't have a long-term reliability perspective since I've only had it a short time, but I've made 10 batches of gelato in it now, and it's perfect every time. I pre-cool the unit for 10 minutes by turning on the compressor before making the gelato. I always use fully chilled base in the fridge for at least several hours. Using it in that manner, my churning time is 15 minutes every time, and it comes out very smooth and perfect. I set the timer for 20 minutes, and when it approaches 15 minutes in I just listen to the churning, as soon as I start to hear the motor start to work a little harder I know it's done and I stop there.

THE ONLY annoying thing about this unit is the old-fashioned ticking countdown timer can't be reset to 0 manually, once you turn it on you have to just let it count down, so even if you shut the unit off early before the timer is done it just sits there ticking and counting down until the time is up and then ""ding"" it lets you know the timer is done. It's just and old-fashioned design, but at the same time it will probably last forever since it's a very basic analog timer and not some fancy digital timer that relies on a computer chip.

So I think the bottom line is if you want to make gelato frequently, and you don't mind spending a few extra bucks on a premium appliance that you'll plan to own for decades, this is worth it. If you start doing the ""I can make the same quality gelato in a unit that costs less....."" comparison, then this isn't for you. Maybe you can or maybe you can't make the same quality gelato in the Cuisinart or Breville or the junky Amazon chinabdrand one, but you can FOR SURE make the highest quality gelato in this one and you'll enjoy owning something this nice (and Italian).",https://www.amazon.com/Lello-Musso-Lussino-1-5-Quart-Stainless/dp/B00004RDF0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31U03XBHKUMO5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iXlysYCg0z8XEdEPjHGk2kJC_fdcMEbmIRU8o4BjybTGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.ZMutt-h32Z9VEDOvq-w0r6OPQBIKqJP3M2dLoBEOKkY&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00004RDF0&qid=1716402056&sprefix=b00004rdf0%2Caps%2C198&sr=8-1,2021

Perfect Blue [DVD],"Well Done, But Confusing","January 3, 2021",3,"This is a well-drawn animated film with a psychotic-fan plot.
It is very effective -- I was flabbergasted when the villain was revealed.
The problem I had was that I couldn't always tell what was real and what was not. This is more complicated than may first appear.
The heroine is a pop star who moves over to acting. This creates three levels of reality:
1. what happens in her dreams/imagination
2. what happens when she is acting, that is, making a movie or TV show
3. actual reality
It isn't always clear which level we are on. I didn't really like that in /Dark Swan/, I didn't really like it here either.
But that's just me. You may like it a whole lot better.
It certainly delivers on the psychotic fan!",https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Blue-Junko-Iwao/dp/B00000JL42/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3HSBCITO53ZR4&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.N2kFqWN-E9kfDqJAt7V2yQ.HDGkW32ft8qfB2n-JOTVJ2tqN2yOa0CdwoBVrQmgj44&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000JL42&qid=1716379434&sprefix=b00000jl42%2Caps%2C343&sr=8-1,2021

Brave New World,Great songs,"June 11, 2021",4,"I was reluctant to purchase this album on account of many of the less-than-favorable reviews I saw, claiming that the songs were disjointed, non-Styx-like, etc. This was clearly created during the time when DDY and the other band members were in friction. In all honesty, the Tommy Shaw and JY songs are all great, modernized Styx tunes. Some are strongly reminiscent of Shaw's 1998 solo album, which I think is very good. The DDY songs are typically and rather unpleasantly sappy, but overall, the other songs outweigh this drawback. It definitely brings Styx into the 21st century. If you enjoy Cyclorama, then this is in that same vain. The band is fantastic, and cannot help sounding differently than it did in the 1970's.

Song For America,Vinyl releases at their finest!,"August 20, 2021",5,"I bought the first KANSAS album in 1974, and saw them on tour at Grove City University just prior to the release of this, their second album. I have never missed buying a new KANSAS release on release day since 1974! Like many people, in the 80s when it looked like vinyl was obsolete, I sold many of the albums I had (a couple thousand!) including my KANSAS collection up to and including POWER, the last of the vinyl for many years. I of course, replaced all of the albums with CDS, and just in the past couple of years have been buying vinyl again because I like the overall sound quality much better than CDS, and especially MP3 versions. I personally like the dynamic range of vinyl much better. The bass sounds better to me, and the warmth of the vinyl is soothing and not harsh to my ears AND body. Dropping the needle on these FRIDAY releases is a better experience than it was in the 70s and 80s when I first got this music. SONG FOR AMERICA has some amazing music! The title track, of course, but the majestic LAMPLIGHT SYMPHONY always dug deep into my soul. Passionate, powerful and graceful. Steve Walsh sang his heart out, and Robby Steinhardt's violin take this song to places unimaginable. The original 6 members of the band with the ever thoughtful and searching writing of Kerry Livgren will never be matched by any other group of musicians. At the time Kerry was soul searching and his writing moved many young people like myself to look deeper. (Sadly, he took a turn into Contemporary Christian Music and never found a combination of musicians to come close to the presentation of his ideas like these guys. This album also features the epic INCOMUDRO - HYMN TO THE ATMAN, a 12 minute progressive rock journey that will rock your very soul! Every song on this release is excellent, but I have to mention the incredible DOWN THE ROAD, a rockin' song that features the late singer/violinist co - front man, Robby Steinhardt. This was always a show stopper in concert. So, anyone buying the vinyl will probably know all of this information, but I HIGHLY recommend ANY vinyl products from FRIDAY MUSIC. The 180gm vinyl sounds incredible! This album EVEN COMES AS A GATEFOLD, which it had never been on it's original release! You just can't go wrong with the FRIDAY LABEL when they have their hands on a classic release like this!!",https://www.amazon.com/Song-America-Kansas/dp/B000002541/ref=sr_1_1?crid=26C1YEFN6SUO6&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.daFXHrdeoWOUZko77xJZrA.jhWEnfwz_2i-HVO1Pr0386pU3uUaxn-gmEDXWpDVfao&dib_tag=se&keywords=B000002541&qid=1716302308&sprefix=b000002541%2Caps%2C363&sr=8-1,2021

"Lello 4080 Musso Lussino 1.5-Quart Ice Cream Maker, Stainless - 110/120V 60 HZ","Quiet, simple to use, works just fine","May 24, 2021",5,"a. takes about 20 minutes. to freeze up a quart of ice cream.
b. it is nice and quiet running... not like a hand crank, or motorized ICE & SALT unit.
c. Tried 2 different mixes - both were creamy & smooth.

For real SUCCESS: let the dry mix & milk/water mixture sit in the fridge for 2 hours after mixing - not to prechill, but to allow enough time for the mixture to really combine. there is NO short cut, no, a blender does not speed it up, just mix it up, stick it in the fridge, maybe mix it again after an hour, but, in 2hrs of ""chillin' in da fridge"", it's ready to go - super creamy & smooth!

For FAILURE: Mix it up, don't taste test (daughter forgot to add SUGAR - ugh!), and don't let it sit for 2hrs in the fridge to fully combine. What you'll get is cream separation (yellow butter streaks & clumps), sugar lumps (even if you use a blender to really mix it - nope, we did that too).

We went with THIS unit, because the paddle was METAL. I had worked on these big units before - replaced plenty of broken parts for various reasons (unit set too cold, usually). It cost more, but we expect it to last longer too.

1.5qts sounds small - BUT, it's done in 20 minutes. Guess what! A 2 quart machine... takes 30 minutes!
The bowl doesn't come out - yeah, you WIPE it out, wash off the paddle, and it's clean.

Downside: It takes up counter space, like every other appliance, where the heck do you STORE these kinds of things that probably get used on weekends...?
----- updated ----

We ordered the Whynter ICM-201SB, and the another unit about 2x the price.
the Whynter ICM-201SB will freeze till it gets a little stiff, like milkshake consistency, and the motor peters out... a bit on the slushy or soft for a cone. OK, so we put it into the freezer - and the ice cream became a ICE-BRICK.

If the freezer is working correctly, it will add AIR into the ice cream as it freezes, giving you in volume more, with the air whipped into it. That's what makes it scoopable when it's really frozen hard. This machine does not do that, because it bogs down. After freezing, you'll have to let the ice cream ""warm up"" if you'd like to scoop it.

We make Vanilla, Chocolate, Lime-Vanilla flavors, from 3 different companies, between the Whynter ICM-201SB and the Lello 4080 Musso Lussino 1.5-Quart Ice Cream Maker. Both are brand new, one was ordered by accident.

Both machines got the exact same mix, chilled for 2 hrs before being put into the machines.

Lello 4080 Musso Lussino - ice cream increased in volume, as expected, was very stiff, and after being put into the freezer, was easily scoopable, able to stuff into a cone, stack 2-4 scoops high, as expected. the machine was cleaned with a warm rag, the parts are all metal, probably last a long time. machine is quiet. Bottom line: It does exactly what we expected, FREEZES ice cream mix properly, not leaving us with slush.

Whynter ICM-201SB - ice cream did not increase in volume, was quite soft when scooped out, and froze into a rock hard brick, which we chiseled apart to get it out of the container. right out of the machine, It was too soft to put into a cone without running all over. the machine was easy to clean, remove the bowl and wash it out, along with the paddle/stirrer. machine is quiet. If you want milkshakes - this is your machine, we were not impressed.",https://www.amazon.com/Lello-Musso-Lussino-1-5-Quart-Stainless/dp/B00004RDF0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31U03XBHKUMO5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iXlysYCg0z8XEdEPjHGk2kJC_fdcMEbmIRU8o4BjybTGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.ZMutt-h32Z9VEDOvq-w0r6OPQBIKqJP3M2dLoBEOKkY&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00004RDF0&qid=1716402056&sprefix=b00004rdf0%2Caps%2C198&sr=8-1,2021
Kid A,A seminal masterpiece,"February 18, 2021",5,"First, for many years I was put off from Radiohead by ""OK Computer."" It was only five or six years ago that I began listening to some of their more recent releases, beginning with ""The King of Limbs,"" which I consider their second masterpiece. I also love the remixes of that album on ""TKOL RMS 1234567."" Nearly as good is ""Moon Shaped Pool."" Radiohead's fifth album, ""Amnesiac,"" was recorded at the same time as the music on ""Kid A,"" but in the end released separately a year later. I think it was a good choice, since the best of those tracks are on ""Kid A,"" which I consider their first masterpiece. The packaging alone is a masterwork of numerous fold-out pages and translucent overlays. It took a few minutes to find the actual recording and track information.

Apparently, following ""OK Computer"" Yorke was burned out and looking for a new direction. He was influenced by a few ambient/electronic musicians and groups of the time, which led to the completely new sound of the tracks on this record—sounds, especially rhythms, that form the roots of Radiohead's music ever since, as well as that of Yorke's Atoms for Peace project. ""Kid A"" is probably the most important recording by Radiohead.",https://www.amazon.com/Kid-Radiohead/dp/B00004XONN/ref=sr_1_1?crid=X6KGARGJXXUD&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.DfEgN3kHLezvSGaUhgs6Aw.gCThQD7-l8NSKEo2639GEXB9dWn3wEZBJBOdy4GBkSw&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00004XONN&qid=1716243549&sprefix=b00004xonn%2Caps%2C184&sr=8-1,2021

"iLight Mini Smartphone 11 Pro The World's Smallest 11 Pro Android Mobile Phone, Super Small Micro 2.5"" Touch Screen Global Unlocked Great for Kids 1GB RAM / 8GB ROM Tiny iPhone XI Pro Look Alike",You know why you're buying this,"July 20, 2021",5,"The reason you're buying this is most likely because it's a tiny gimmick of a phone. Of course. I dare say, it's better than the ""haha"" I had hoped it would give me, and gave me the ""please be more than useable"" I really wanted.

The TL;DR is IT WORKS. ITS FUN. ITS TINY. ITS AMAZING. BUY THIS PHONE, THE PRICE IS WORTH IT. Seriously. I'm so extremely elated to own a tiny phone like this that can do most everything I expected from it.

To start, the screen. It's tiny, yes, but it's also looks pretty good. Peel off the manufacturer's fuzzy screen protector, and you have a serviceable screen. At that size, you need a high enough resolution that gives you clarity, and this phone delivers. Also, the text all seem to be manipulated by a custom android OS made to give legibility and formatting to work on the small screen. Chrome and other apps were all sized and formatted in a way that everything was easy to read, no need to zoom.

You might think typing is difficult on the screen, but my secret weapon for you is Gboard. Download the keyboard from the Play store, and turn on Glide. Boom, you can now swipe/Swype/glide with ease. I typed my typical book-long messages to my viewers in Discord with ease. Hangouts? No issues. Side note: there is a custom keyboard in it, it might have glide/Swype, but I didn't use it. Gboard is my jam, so I went with that.

I downloaded quite a few apps for this phone, and some intensive games. They all ran acceptably, but a few stuttered. Honestly, if you want to game hardcore, you're looking at the wrong phone. Emulating with a Bluetooth controller, though? Chefs kiss, babay, it handles the classics of the 16 bit era quite well. Definitely a nice teeny pocket handheld. And, hey, Alto's Adventure ran beautifully.

Quick tip: use Nova Launcher and give it a more traditional Android look, it'll make the phone feel more complete. It runs perfectly with a custom launcher.

The typical features of a phone were all FINE on this. Great volume, strong vibrate, the Bluetooth worked wonderfully to make this an MP3 player, and so on. The cameras on the front and back are pretty low quality in low light, but they snapped acceptable pics. You'll be wanting a different device for higher quality photos, come on. Battery life is great. Full charge in an hour, idled on for three days without dying. I left it sitting at 75 percent, from me playing on it for about 45 minutes. It might not be an all day phone using it nonstop, but the faster charge is nice.

Phone calls were great. If you don't want to hold a tiny phone, use Bluetooth. I used it, with zero issue, perfect call quality. Any bad areas in town were still bad areas with this phone, but that's to be expected.

Oh, also, it came with all the goodies. A screen protector. Charging cable. Sim card slot puller. AND A CUTE LITTLE CASE.

I use a Note 20 Ultra as my daily phone. I used this for 5 days straight, and will keep carrying it around, along with that behemoth. I'm in love with it. It's ridiculous, you know this. But, it's actually serviceable, if you need a small alternative. Will it fit every situation? Maybe not. But it'll most likely fill yours, if you're here. The price is about right, in my humble opinion.

I will be posting a video of my time with it elsewhere, keep an eye out for Havok Versus Everything, or find me just to chat. I will yell about how much I love this thing.

If you have any more questions, ask in the question section and I will answer the best I can. There's too much to say, and a lot of intricacies to owning a phone I might not have thought of off the top of my head. I got ya, just ask.",https://www.amazon.com/Smartphone-iLight-11-Pro-Smallest/dp/B091JHNTNH/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3D7QGCEHHH5JU&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JIoWKIqBS8XKlUeWvagGRSDg-jIHPxjrZegztTcwMbfGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.x09Q2r5SwRHZ34ggsRUvgsQBp3slZL3Dffnu5E_rBy0&dib_tag=se&keywords=iphone+11&qid=1714428467&refinements=p_89%3AiLight&rnid=2528832011&s=wireless&sprefix=iphone+11+%2Caps%2C195&sr=1-1,2021

The Sword in the Stone (Disney Gold Classic Collection) [DVD],Comparison of Both Versions on Amazon Prime,"January 10, 2021",5,"As of January 9, 2021, there are two versions available to rent on Amazon Prime (for the same price):

""The Sword in the Stone"" has thick black bars on the left and right of the screen but it shows nearly the entire frame; for example, in a scene at 0:04:30, you can see the ground below Merlin's feet when he's at the well, while in the other version he chopped off at the knees.

Mary Poppins [VHS],Disney's Seminal Classic,"June 17, 2021",5,"It seems superfluous to give this classic work a review. The movie is ""perfect in every way"". In this day and age when many movies hold on to questionable morals ""Mary Poppins"" stands out as an upbeat story. It teaches the value of the family and seems to focus on the influence of the father in the home and how he can influence his children.

The movie starts out with the theme of the iconic song ""Feed the Birds"" which teaches Charity, Compassion and Love for our neighbor. The story is nicely paced. Every single song is a classic which will stay with you forever. The superbly choreographed ""Step in Time"" is delightful.

Don't miss this movie. Their is nothing bad to be said about this movie.

A great follow up movie is ""Saving Mr. Banks"". It is a delightful ""back story"" behind the production of the movie ""Mary Poppins"". It will lift your heart!

Zombie Heaven,Amazingly music comes back from the dead to be devoured.,"October 31, 2021",5,"A (nearly) perfect collection that gathers everything The Zombies recorded during their career. My only complaint is that some of those wonky stereo tracks are missing from this set (and it would have been nice if they could reissue this with properly mastered versions of the remixes that Alec Paleo did).

Their masterpiece “Odessey and Oracle” is included in its entirety along with almost everything else they recorded during their brief, bright career. The mastering and annotation by Alec Paleo is excellent along with great comments from the band members.

The remixed stereo anthology has some nicely done stereo mixes that are balanced better than the original stereo mixes (it’s a separate purchase for those who want to pick it up) and does feature one newly done overdub done for “She’s Not There” (always missing and never done for stereo only mono, this was done directly to the mono mix and never has been on the stereo mix of the song) but, that aside, this makes the perfect compliment to this set.

"Officemate Heavy Duty Weighted 2-in-1 Tape Dispenser, Recycled,Black (96660)",GREAT!,"July 29, 2021",5,"I’m very pleased with this purchase.

This is a very heavy/sturdy tape rack. Because of its weight, it’s not ideal to keep moving out of place but I’m still able to carefully carry it whenever I need it for other projects around the house (outside my home office, where I keep this rack).

I’m happy that I don’t need to hold on to this rack in order to pull the tape. This is true for both small and large tape rolls! I’ve been using this rack for about a month or a bit longer and find that both are good quality tapes.

You do have to be a bit careful as sometimes the larger tape blade fails to cut it properly. As long as you’re careful to push the tape downward and not too harshly or too quickly, it works fine.

Fast Prime shipping and it arrived in perfect condition in its own box was inside the Amazon packaging box.

It's no Blade Runner or Terminator, but still really enjoyable, and the first time Arnold had a lot of lines to say in a movie. Casting the game show host Richard Dawson as the host of Running Man was brilliant.

Other than recommending it, I don't think I have a lot to add. When deciding whether to upgrade my old DVD to Blu Ray the first review that came up complained about the transfer. This is definitely a Hi Definition transfer, and much better quality than the letter box DVD I had previously. What might throw you is that the opening graphics might have been cgi (1980s cgi) and the film looks like the cinematographer subconsciously wanted it to be black and white. The transfer was probably from a vault copy of the film, not the negative. Its a clean transfer of a clean copy of the film. It would have been a sound artistic decision to make this film in black and white, the film doesn't look like it had as big budget as it did, but it had enough budget that black and white would have been out of the question.",https://www.amazon.com/Running-Man-VHS-Arnold-Schwarzenegger/dp/B00000JGEN/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2DCRL59VINJN0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.DgkouRp2bMnfp9MBWUHGZA.TXZVzZzbM__42YpRYPlfJ_BQSWCJLq2RyQokw0L3GbY&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000JGEN&qid=1716372870&sprefix=b00000jgen%2Caps%2C333&sr=8-1,2021

Over the past year or two i've been revisiting the first 5 Jokers cards and their EPs from the 90s and the first two Forgotten Freshness volumes and I must say their old music holds up really well.

Riddlebox and Great Milenko in particular are their best albums in my humble opinion. The beats hit hard, the lyrics are over the top and comical and the songs are really catchy.

This is the finest on-screen depiction of the Robin Hood legend--in fact, Howard Pyle's original should be revised and re-structured to include Sir Hiss, one of the most hilarious characters you'll ever see in animated form.

"Lello 4080 Musso Lussino 1.5-Quart Ice Cream Maker, Stainless - 110/120V 60 HZ",The only machine to consider if you love ice cream,"January 9, 2021",5,"I’ve made my own ice cream for about 20 years, mainly with a Cuisinart canister style machine and then with a Whynter compressor machine. The difference in performance between those machines and the Lello is like comparing a Ford Pinto to a Ferrari. I read a review that said the Lello was the best, but for the average home user the performance wasn’t so much better to justify the price. I totally disagree with a caveat. I never use more than a 1/2 cup of cream in a quart of ice cream. My guess is that there is a more similar performance from the Cuisinart if you are making a recipe that calls for 2-3 cups of cream, but if you want to make lower fat ice cream without a bunch of fillers or stabilizers, the Lello is the only ice cream maker to consider. The difference in consistency is amazing. If you make a lot of ice cream (the only store bought ice cream I liked went out of business at the beginning of the pandemic, so we make at least 2 quarts of ice cream a week — I have 5 go to flavors that I like to always have on hand) this machine is definitely worth the price. I did pay for the extended warranty, which I never do, because my Whynter machine died a month after the warranty expired and I wanted to make sure I would have this machine for at least 4 years. Besides price, the other reason I initially hesitated on this machine was the non-removable bowl and how hard it would be to clean, but with a sponge it is super easy and a bonus that everything touching your ice cream is stainless steel,",https://www.amazon.com/Lello-Musso-Lussino-1-5-Quart-Stainless/dp/B00004RDF0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31U03XBHKUMO5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iXlysYCg0z8XEdEPjHGk2kJC_fdcMEbmIRU8o4BjybTGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.ZMutt-h32Z9VEDOvq-w0r6OPQBIKqJP3M2dLoBEOKkY&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00004RDF0&qid=1716402056&sprefix=b00004rdf0%2Caps%2C198&sr=8-1,2021

Mary Poppins [VHS],As charming today as when we were kids,"June 29, 2021",5,"My wife and I grew up watching Mary Poppins on TV once a year, the GenXers who fell in love with Mary and Bert and the family of Banks. So when Amazon had a nice deal on buying the streaming version, we had to get it. We’ve watched it again and Mary Poppins remains as charming as ever.

If you don’t know the story: The Banks family - father, mother, son and daughter - struggle to understand one another in Edwardian England when women were fighting for the vote and men expected the children to be seen and not heard. As the children drive away each nanny, the children send their wishes out into an ill wind and in flies Mary Poppins. Along with her friend, Bert, Mary will take the children on numerous adventures and help their parents rediscover the joy of life with children. If you’ve never seen it, this is a movie known for it’s charming and memorable songs and moments. Feed the Birds is one of my favorite song (overall) but don’t forget the other fun ones you’ll come away singing forever (think ear worms).

If you’ve never seen it, spend some time with Mary and Bert and the Banks family. And if you have, come back for another visit. If you have kids, sit and watch together and rediscover the joy of time with people you love. It’s charming and sweet and saccharine, and you’ll remember it for a long time to come.

I purchased this pruner as a replacement. It is very disappointing. The blades do not open automatically.

It takes 2-4 times to actually cut the branch. The ""ratchet"" feature does not always engage.

Young Carlos delighted the crowd, an audience eager to let loose for Ms. Joplin. The wait was not too long, but long enough for me to recognize Santana's talent and unique sound. SUPERNATURAL showcases the highly refined musicianship of Carlos and his other musicians. He collaborates with a variety of well-chosen vocalists. Exciting album! The engineers help to create a consistently brilliant sound. The percussion is strong and enhances the overall rhythm. More than once I was tempted to stand up and dance a salsa.

"Officemate Heavy Duty Weighted 2-in-1 Tape Dispenser, Recycled,Black (96660)",Fits packing tape perfectly. Does NOT fit heat tape or painter's tape perfectly.,"August 26, 2022",3,"Second update: after using this with packing tape/scotch tape, I find the cutting bar isn't very good. My packing tape just doesn't cut easily or cleanly. I wish it was sharper. I have to reduce my stars because of it.

Update: after using this for a while with heat tape and packing tape, I got frustrated with it and decided to cancel my second order. I still give the dispenser 5 stars for packing tape and scotch tape. But the cutting edge doesn't work well with heat tape or packing tape. The tape kept falling off the cutting bar. Shoot! Thought I had a great solution for my crafting table, but it's back to the drawing board to find something new. I would still recommend the dispenser for packing tape/scotch tape.

Original review:
I really like this tape dispenser and gave it 5 stars for its intended purpose, which is scotch tape and packing tape. It works perfectly for that application. However; I bought this for a crafting table with the idea that I could have heat tape on the larger side. Unfortunately, the core of heat tape is slightly bigger than packing tape, so it does not fit quite right and rolls around loosely. I also found that painter's tape doesn't fit quite right either. It's a little more snug, but still a bit loose. I decided to keep the dispenser, however, and made a modification to keep the rolls from falling off the sides. I took some electrical tape and cut it lengthwise to make a skinny strip and wound it around the very edge of the dispenser core to build up a lip on the edge - not so much that I couldn't get the roll over the ridge, but enough to keep the heat tape from falling off once installed. The heat tape is very skinny, so there was room leftover and I put painter's tape on the other side of the large core. That one fits better, but does kind of roll around too. I might make a ridge of electrical tape on that side also to keep everything in place. It's possible I could fit a second roll of heat tape on as well, if I make my electrical tape ""lip"" a little narrower. The nice thing about this setup is that because the rolls don't fit tightly, they move independently of each other, and so this setup functions well. I can pull tape off of either the heat tape or painter's tape, without the other roll moving with it, if that makes sense. The scotch tape side works just fine as is. So now I have 3 different types of tape on my crafting table and I like it! The compartment slot in the dispenser is great to hold weeding tools, scissors, a scoring tool, tweezers, etc. It's a nice addition to my table. I will say that this dispenser is pretty bulky, so make sure you have the space for it. It is heavy, which is great for keeping it in place while you pull the tape. I like this so much that I decided to purchase a second one for my desk and use it for its intended purpose - packing tape and scotch tape. I'll use the compartment slot for pens and pencils.",https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CT3WGX6?pd_rd_i=B07CT3WGX6&pf_rd_p=2f0a8989-0b67-47e7-b61e-9e3ef9908602&pf_rd_r=EZKZ9JJVBTVTR3E9Z6F4&pd_rd_wg=tVs7G&pd_rd_w=EUPSL&pd_rd_r=a86dd523-d4e9-46b5-8b39-0342d21c7098&th=1,2022

Christmas in Connecticut [VHS],"Still wonderful after all these years, and great historical insights!","December 30, 2022",4,"Though slightly romanticized, this movie is a must-see to understand society (and how it changed) at the end of World War II. Yes, women worked, and - as lifestyle journalists - even bluffed their way through what they wrote. And romance could be a somewhat ""musical chairs"" experience, as singles suddenly had more opportunities to meet and fall in love.

This is a delightful, feel-good romantic comedy. If you like ""White Christmas"" (the classic), I think you'll enjoy this, too.

Robin Hood (Disney Gold Classic Collection),Adorable Disney Classic in Glorious Hi-Def.,"October 3, 2022",5,"Not much to be said about this movie other than it's a childhood favorite and it's a sweet, quick fun little rendition of the classic tale of Robin Hood told with cute humanoid animals.

Great voice acting, endearing animation that's a tad rough around the edges but still has a charming old school Saturday Morning Cartoon-esque aesthetic. Classic Disney film. Highly recommended.

"Lello 4080 Musso Lussino 1.5-Quart Ice Cream Maker, Stainless - 110/120V 60 HZ",2023Edit: What Ice Cream Dreams are Made Of…why has the price gone up?,"April 26, 2022",5,"Edited after a year’s use:
This machine is a mighty beast!!! I bought it to start a small batch gourmet ice cream business and it has not disappointed. My only issue is churning 1 qt at a time is not cost effective. So, I bought the 2qt machine from the same company and it is not remotely as well made as the “Baby Musso” - in fact it is a POS waste od space & money.
I came here to potentially buy another Musso, but it is now $1026 here on Amazon! I paid $620 last year! Meanwhile the machine that is double it’s size has gone down in price. That should tell you everything about the superior Musso! Not sure why the significant difference in performance and function, but as a professional ice cream maker it is shockingly noticeable how bad the larger machine is. I’m here to tell you if you can swing the $1026 go ahead and do it you will not be disappointed!

I had previously purchased the Cuisinart ICE100, it just didn’t get cold enough even with pre chilling the bowl and ice cream base. And if you add commercial stabilizer and/or have a fudgier chocolate base (or cream cheese) the ICE 100 would simply quit. Im I’m an accomplished self taught baker, so I approached ice cream making with an eye for maximum fresh flavors with premium level density. However, it took mishaps with the ICE 100 to bring me around to the Maserati of frisen dessert makers! Hoooo-lah!!! What an epic beauty is this machine!? I had made 4 very dense, richly flavored bases that cured for 48 hours in my fridge. I set the timer to 40 minutes as a guide because the ICE 100 required, well, longer than that. I let the bowl chill up for 4 minutes, added the base (a bit too much! 775ml. I had to stop dasher to remove 100ml), and I swear it was thoroughly done (see photo) in 17 minutes!!!!! I made a second batch of same base directly after scooping out first run and that one finished in roughly 14.5 minutes. I’m blown away. Absolutely worth the investment as I’m planning to launch a mobile scoop shop. I will say the instructions are lacking. I wish they had added some tips on efficient usage when running batches back to back because between the first and second runs I stopped the dasher but not compressor (button with snowflake icon) to add second batch and when I started dasher up the machine made scary noises! I even heard a frying/crackling sound inside and dasher seemed a bit slow yet base was still liquid. Anyone have that happen? I’m running a few more tonight for a client b day party hope it’s ok! 😬 Anyway, so far, so fantastic!",https://www.amazon.com/Lello-Musso-Lussino-1-5-Quart-Stainless/dp/B00004RDF0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31U03XBHKUMO5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iXlysYCg0z8XEdEPjHGk2kJC_fdcMEbmIRU8o4BjybTGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.ZMutt-h32Z9VEDOvq-w0r6OPQBIKqJP3M2dLoBEOKkY&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00004RDF0&qid=1716402056&sprefix=b00004rdf0%2Caps%2C198&sr=8-1,2022

"Mac Book Pro Charger - 118W USB C Charger Fast Charger for USB C Port MacBook pro/Air, ipad Pro, Samsung Galaxy and All USB C Device, Include Charge Cable（7.2ft/2.2m）",Great deal!,"October 17, 2022",5,"I was very surprised when I found this product, which includes the cable for only $30. Originally, I was just looking to replace my factory Apple charging block for my MacBook Pro, and was fully prepared to spend $70 on the block, and up to another $20-30 on the cable. In fact, I went to Best Buy, looking to do just that - but they no longer sold the original Apple product. So, instead, I spent $70 on some off-brand which I didn’t like, for multiple reasons..

First of all, if I’m going to spend that much money, I’m buying the original Apple product; it’s as simple as that. So, I bought the damn thing temporarily, just to have something to use until I could order the Apple one; which, in fact, I was searching for here on Amazon, and surprisingly did not find. That’s how I found this product, instead.

Now, I’m a bit of a review snob. If a product isn’t 4.5+ stars, with a credible amount of reviews, I’m probably not buying it. But, even at this price point, this product was holding a full five stars - so I settled on trying it, instead of going directly to Apple. I love it, honestly. I don’t have any REAL complaints. Just one tiny little thing, that doesn’t really matter. Especially at the end of the day, for this price.

The one that I returned to Best Buy drove me INSANE, because the damn thing was so heavy that it sagged from every outlet you plugged it into. It didn’t feel ANYTHING like the original Apple charger, and it CONSTANTLY fell out of the socket and interrupted my usage experience. Oh, man I cannot tell you how annoying that was.. and I forget why, now but there was something else about the cable, too that just felt nothing like the one I had been using for the last five years. I just, hated it. All around.

This bundle, though is almost exactly the same size as the Apple one, and even a smidge smaller, I think, which is nice. It’s light, as it should be and it actually stays plugged in. That was a pleasant surprise, because at this point I wasn’t sure what to expect. I have no complaints whatsoever about the charging block (which is the expensive part, obviously). I have no use for about half of the power of this thing, since my device only uses a maximum of just over 60 watts, so I can’t attest to an increase in charging speed, or anything like that. But, as a replacement for the factory original device, for even less than half the price, I can say that I am surprisingly pleased.

One of the great things about USB-C and Power Delivery, is that overkill is no problem. It’s not like there’s any worry of pulling too much power, and damaging your device. So, for the fact that this product successfully works as a replacement for my Apple charger, AND includes a free upgrade to upgrade-proof, especially at this price point, is just a really nice added bonus.

The only complaint that I have, is with the cable. It is decently annoying, but it doesn’t bother me because the product overall is such a great value. When plugged in to my MacBook Pro, it will (pretty often, actually) slip out of the USB-C port, justtt enough to disconnect from the device and stop charging. I have to gently snug it back in there, and it only moves this tiny little indeterminate amount. You would never be able to tell, by just looking at it that the connector isn’t fully seated in place, but when you slide it back in, you can feel it move a teeny bit, and you can feel it kind of snap back into place. Again, moderately annoying, but I don’t particularly find this to be a bother, considering I was perfectly willing and prepared to spend 2-3 times the amount of this product on the genuine Apple version. For the value? I really can’t complain.

Plus, if I ever decide that it indeed IS a bother, I could always buy another cable for $20 or less. Hell, I could even buy one straight from Apple, and I’m STILL saving money. So, again, I really can’t complain. For the manufacturer, though: I would definitely recommend replacing the cable that you offer, with this bundle to eliminate this issue. Cables are cheap, and even if you have to raise the price on this bundle accordingly (what, $1.00? $1.50?), it’s worth it to do so. I mean, come on; the charging block itself is a great value, at this price. The cable is just a bonus, anyway.",https://www.amazon.com/Mac-Book-Pro-Charger-Cable%EF%BC%887-2ft/dp/B0B1HJ666G/ref=sr_1_4?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.2OaHMNe7NEOhdoIhVZWrOdlhN3dgkGrhklJBKa3S34YzQ39G5aaZxeyAoYuyjtx9ZPIyI-imuP1VfiBIzZLabxUFZhtOISthDF6Gm5q3GQGyAfmm6LWGZNWffSNakshEhzZ8-J83laxbuwvt7aCKVDtBgj0r5Gjv4OStpVes7uM3nqDG8KVvGBiFh744YZzw7oIBP3v8lGI7qfsCJNsjOMkoBCbh4-791UG4qD68Co5_Pb335TL3ztb6RDNb3syWz87crU_f3blh1J8xRNaGtuNOwb3xSMgCMzk9j5butHA.qSTk7AAeUqBIVlodbu0wL5SaKfC-QQzjL70ZxbchEYk&dib_tag=se&qid=1714142734&s=computers-intl-ship&sr=1-4,2022

Taming of the Shrew -DVD,Excellent DVD quality. Funny romantic comedy.,"April 2, 2022",5,"The quality of this DVD is excellent. The colors are just as vibrant as they originally were on the big screen, and the audio is loud and clear. Letterbox shows the panorama of the breathtaking Italian countryside. English subtitles are available and easy to activate.

As for the movie itself, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton did give wonderful performances. Burton, in particular, was in his comfort zone because his strong resume consisted of successfully playing many Shakespearean roles live on the stage in England. As a result, he portrayed the loud, obnoxious character of Petruchio brilliantly. Taylor, who had never performed as a Shakespearan character, was not so self-confident in her role as the ill-tempered and aggressive (aka shrewish) Katharina, but director Franco Zeffirelli was very pleased with her performance. According to some trivia notes, Zeffirelli said that making this movie was the most fun he'd had in his entire filmmaking career.

Instead of the normal book-page slot thing for individual discs, both the Blu-Ray and normal DVD disc was stacked on top of each other on one single side. That means if you want to take out the disc on the backside, you have to take out the disc on the front just to take it out safely. When it arrived, the back disc wasn’t even clicked in properly.

Perfect Blue [DVD],"A landmark for animated films.

It's also arguably a stretch to label it ""horror""; most viewers tend to regard it as a thriller}.

It's been decades now since 'Perfect Blue' hit the scene and I still struggle to name another animated contemporary-set psychological thriller, and that's a shame, because the movie proved that not only can animation handle this kind of story with aplomb, but it showed in some respects animation was even better suited for it than live action.

Perfect Blue [DVD],Trippy Psychological Anime (Spoiler Free),"January 2, 2022",4,">> This review does not contain spoilers or a synopsis of the movie.

If you enjoy psychological horror/thrillers and adult-oriented anime, this cult classic is for you! This animated movie was created by the legendary artist, the late Satoshi Kon (rest-in-peace). Satoshi Kon is best known for pioneering mind-blowing transitions and reality-warping storytelling in the anime genre and this movie is the perfect representation. Perfect Blue is the predecessor Kon’s other famous works such as the movie Paprika and the TV series Paranoia Agent, which I also recommend watching.

The only reason I would not recommend this film is if you are uncomfortable with depictions of r-a-p-e, uncensored m-u-r-d-e-r, and female n-u-d-i-t-y. As such, this anime film contains adult themes and a dark, twisted storyline that should only be seen by those who are over the age of 18. Perfect Blue is not an offensive or grotesque anime by any means, but the sensitive topics that are displayed should not be viewed by children.

Most Asian films and shows include the English subtitled version with the original language and sometimes an English adaptation if the work becomes popular amongst Westerners, but weirdly enough this somewhat obscure, Japanese anime only contains the English adaptation. I do not remember seeing any options in the menu to select versions that contain the original Japanese voice-acting with/without subtitles. If you prefer “dubs” over “subs”, then you are in luck!

>> TLDR; Must-watch if you are a “sophisticated” anime connoisseur. Rated R for anime tiddies.",https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Blue-Junko-Iwao/dp/B00000JL42/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3HSBCITO53ZR4&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.N2kFqWN-E9kfDqJAt7V2yQ.HDGkW32ft8qfB2n-JOTVJ2tqN2yOa0CdwoBVrQmgj44&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000JL42&qid=1716379434&sprefix=b00000jl42%2Caps%2C343&sr=8-1,2022

"Lello 4080 Musso Lussino 1.5-Quart Ice Cream Maker, Stainless - 110/120V 60 HZ",19 years later,"September 25, 2022",5,"I bought this from Amazon in February 2003, and thought it was about time to testify to its durability.

I've made hundreds of batches of ice cream over the past nearly 20 years with it. I have never had it serviced.

In the early days, I was worried that the paddle was looking a little oxidized, so I contacted the manufacturer, and they cheerfully (seriously) sent me another, no problem. I kept both, and it turns out that my concern was exaggerated, and it was just a little discolored.

I got a couple of scares with it in the last couple of years. Twice, the churn motor wouldn't turn, even with no resistance, and I thought it had met its demise; however, rumors of its death were greatly exaggerated. It just needed to cool down thoroughly, and it ran again. I don't understand how it still chills like it did in 2003.

When I got it, my daughter had just turned 9, and would spend some of her summers with me. It was a great way to entertain her and give her a break from my otherwise healthy-food obsession. She's now 26 and still wonders at the fact that I've still got this thing. Now I've got another batch of kids 9, 8, and 6, and they're enjoying it just like their much older sister did.

There's a quirk about this machine in the manual. This was advertised as an Italian ice cream maker (and it is made in Italy), but the manual says about its name: ""Lussino is the name of a beautiful island off the Istria Peninsula and the Dalmatian Coast. At the present time Lussino Island is under the Republic of Croatia, but it is part of the Italian Nation for tradition, heritage, language, and historical links.""",https://www.amazon.com/Lello-Musso-Lussino-1-5-Quart-Stainless/dp/B00004RDF0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31U03XBHKUMO5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iXlysYCg0z8XEdEPjHGk2kJC_fdcMEbmIRU8o4BjybTGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.ZMutt-h32Z9VEDOvq-w0r6OPQBIKqJP3M2dLoBEOKkY&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00004RDF0&qid=1716402056&sprefix=b00004rdf0%2Caps%2C198&sr=8-1,2022

Heat [DVD],A flawed reimagining of Heat in 4K.,"September 10, 2022",3,"Mann went to town on the 2017 remaster, and this one goes even further into dimness and warmth. I can't quite understand why he is doing this to the film, but it is what it is. I guess he really wanted a more LA warm look everything.

Within this questionable color timing, which is vastly different than the blue and sometimes teal 2009 release, Heat 4K looks orange-tinted with yellows filtered into the mix, making even more teal highlights with the blues, but with the strangeness that such a warm transfer imparts. I can kind of see his intent, but this doesn't really give one a totally professional remix.

Problem is Disney cheaped out on this release as they don't seem to much care about some of the studios they acquire. This is a BD66 for a three hour film. There is no Dolby Vision, the slipcover sucks, and the HDR grade is basically barely even there. Atmos you wish.

I just can't quite wrap my head around Mann's tinkering anymore. When did he suddenly hate the bluer original? Even the marketing was in blue.

KEEP your 2009 disc. It's a fine disc even on the old VC-1 encoder, and it looks way more like the film I saw in theaters. This is something different entirely. To call this definitive is probably not quite accurate considering everything this current version is missing. No Atmos might be the biggest sin.

Match that with a photoshop dive job of a cover, and this release is just not very good. They could have done so much better, and we deserve better. The steelbook looks much nicer, but it's also super limited. And for those that care there is an overseas AVC-coded release of Heat with higher bitrate than the OG 2009 version, both being of the same master and color timing.

I really hope someday Heat will get a more authentic release. Until then you can get this one and see a more warmly colored version of this classic, or you can find the 2009 version on bluray for a presentation closer to the original.",https://www.amazon.com/Heat-Al-Pacino/dp/B00000JGHM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3SL469QP21XCV&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.PmNQQE0-VFN54RqcmvdUyg.3_j41rq4emamAewkfOH-l5Es6bm3KQ8RSlHawbxhCdU&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000JGHM&qid=1716373112&sprefix=b00000jghm%2Caps%2C196&sr=8-1,2022

I have pretty good quality speakers and the mix just doesn't seem that good. I understand that this is pretty much how the band sounds themselves, but the vocals could've used a boost or something. The bass is okay, the general instrumentation mix is okay. I don't know if I just haven't noticed it while listening to the album on spotify or wherever, but it's noticeable on this vinyl.

"Lello 4080 Musso Lussino 1.5-Quart Ice Cream Maker, Stainless - 110/120V 60 HZ",Doesn't run out of cold,"October 19, 2022",5,"I've had a few different ice cream makers with the removable bowl that you toss in the freezer. I've had a few disasters, too. These occur when the maker runs out of cold before the ice cream runs out of heat, usually because I've altered the recipe in some fashion. One of these occasions arose a couple days ago: 20 minutes had elapsed, the temperature of the mix was down to 28°, and yet there was no indication it was ready to freeze.

This particular recipe of mine variation took another 25 minutes with a drop to 24° before, blessedly, ice cream appeared. Instead of the mix going down the drain after it failed to freeze in time, it went on to become a family favorite.

I had always assumed the only real advantage of a refrigerated ice cream maker is that you get the better part of a cubic foot back in your freezer. The bigger advantage is that you'll never find yourself pouring a new ice cream mix down the drain.

Oh, and the Musso Lussin is built like a tank yet is half as wide as the competition. True, it's twice as deep, but its prominent rear end slipped back beneath a cabinet in our kitchen into what would otherwise be dead space. That was my main reason for picking it out until I read the reviews and discovered that it also happens to be the best on the market.",https://www.amazon.com/Lello-Musso-Lussino-1-5-Quart-Stainless/dp/B00004RDF0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31U03XBHKUMO5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iXlysYCg0z8XEdEPjHGk2kJC_fdcMEbmIRU8o4BjybTGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.ZMutt-h32Z9VEDOvq-w0r6OPQBIKqJP3M2dLoBEOKkY&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00004RDF0&qid=1716402056&sprefix=b00004rdf0%2Caps%2C198&sr=8-1,2022

Heat [DVD],"Great movie, but the 4k release is really dark","August 27, 2022",3,"I was really looking forward to the 4k release of this movie for months and since pre-ordering Dune earlier this year, it's been the only other movie I payed for early. I have to say that I'm a little bit disappointed in the 4k print of Heat. It is true that most of the movie has never looked better. The day scenes especially look amazing - including the bank heist scene, which is just perfect. The problems come whenever there is a scene set at night... and there are kind of a lot of them in this movie. Details are lost in the shadows of the scene and unless they are directly in a source of light, characters pretty much disappear from sight. I basically had to double check if my settings got changed before watching this movie, but they didn't. I'm using the same settings that I pre-configured for every other movie I have watched. I had to crank up the brightness and switch to Vivid mode on my LG C1 just to be able to see anything. Hopefully you can tell in the pictures I took. It wasn't easy replicating what I see on screen through pictures, but I think they do a decent job. As you can tell though, whenever you have to raise the brightness that much, the blacks turn grey and it makes my OLED look not as good.

So yeah, if I'm scoring just the film it would get a 5/5. It still holds up really well even though it's been 27 years since the original release. But if I'm scoring the entire experience of the 4k Blu Ray print, I can't give it more than 3/5 stars.",https://www.amazon.com/Heat-Al-Pacino/dp/B00000JGHM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3SL469QP21XCV&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.PmNQQE0-VFN54RqcmvdUyg.3_j41rq4emamAewkfOH-l5Es6bm3KQ8RSlHawbxhCdU&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000JGHM&qid=1716373112&sprefix=b00000jghm%2Caps%2C196&sr=8-1,2022

"Lello 4080 Musso Lussino 1.5-Quart Ice Cream Maker, Stainless - 110/120V 60 HZ",I LOVE THIS MACHINE,"May 14, 2022",5,"if you are even THINKING about buying an ice cream maker, this is the one to buy. Yes it costs more than the others, but it is SO worth it.

I've had other machines where you have to pre freeze a bowl and then add your ingredients. The ice cream was never fully frozen and more than one batch was out of the question. Plus the bowls were always flimsy and easily damaged by taking the ice cream out of the bowl.

With this machine, there is no bowl. Turn the machine on and let it get cool, then add your ice cream mix (goes even faster if you chill it first) and pour it into the machine. 15 minutes later you have the best home made ice cream, gelato, or sorbet you've ever had.

Yes, there is some noise. But not any more than any other ice cream machine. And I thought it would be difficult to clean with an integrated hbowl, but you simply scoop out your ice cream with a spatula, (which gets it pretty clean as there are no seams or corners to deal with ) and then use a damp sponge to clean out any remaining ice cream.

The convenience of not have to pre-freeze or worry about puncturing a bowl in the cheaper models is worth the extra money. But add in the all-metal construction, a sturdy as hell motor, and the ability to keep making more ice cream after one or two batches, and this machine is more than worth the premium price.

My ONLY minor complaint is that I wish it had a better way to store the cord, which comes from underneath the unit. But a small cord winder stuck to the side took care of that.

This is one AWESOME machine.",https://www.amazon.com/Lello-Musso-Lussino-1-5-Quart-Stainless/dp/B00004RDF0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31U03XBHKUMO5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iXlysYCg0z8XEdEPjHGk2kJC_fdcMEbmIRU8o4BjybTGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.ZMutt-h32Z9VEDOvq-w0r6OPQBIKqJP3M2dLoBEOKkY&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00004RDF0&qid=1716402056&sprefix=b00004rdf0%2Caps%2C198&sr=8-1,2022

Among the devious reprobates are Lucy Liu, Kris Kristofferson, James Coburn(very good), and a delicious performance by William Devane as Carter. Devane licks his lips, pulls on his $10,000 suit, and oozes evil. Porter manages to get shot, beat-up, and tortured in one scene after another. What a guy? A pawn shop provides him with a Smith and Wesson Model 27 .357 Magnum with a four-inch barrel and custom wood grips. Late in the party, one gangster home is filmed at the Doheny Mansion , on Mount St. Mary's College, 10 Chester Place, Los Angeles.",https://www.amazon.com/Payback-Mel-Gibson/dp/B00000JDIQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2L38VI2M0T5KC&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.irvJDOsuCyRiQ9Z_084ACw.pJ3-8EluK3HjBZpuqiz9TWn6nKeuUQV_2O08HBqzfik&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000JDIQ&qid=1716370143&sprefix=b00000jdiq%2Caps%2C579&sr=8-1,2022

"Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, 512GB, Midnight Green - Unlocked (Renewed Premium)",UPDATED,"August 27, 2022",5,"Worked great for 3 days and then started messing up. I returned for a refund and it’s been NOTHING but problems trying to get my money back. I’ve gotten the run around told several different story’s! I was told I would have my refund back by the 27th here is it the 29th and still haven’t seen the refund. When I try to find out about it all I get is rude agents that are hateful as all get out with no information. There is no problem giving your money but sure is hard to get it back! It’s a hit or miss better off saving for a new one! It’s very aggravating and a headache it’s not $20 or something it’s almost $600. They tell you 2 weeks for your refund but when the 2 weeks come they turn around and say longer than 2 weeks. If you do purchase good luck hopefully you’re experience is better!

I was kinda nervous to buy this as the last phone I got (FROM ANOTHER SELLER) I had problems from the beginning even the 2nd phone they had sent me. But this by far is an amazing purchase! If I didn’t know it was “renewed” I’d swear it was brand new off the shelf! Also came with 100% battery life! Got it yesterday at 8:00am and it’s now 4:23pm the next day and it’s still yet to go dead I’ve not even had to charge it. It did come completely dead but that’s not a big deal I guess. I’ve used it a lot so battery is by far AMAZING! That’s a big plus for me the speakers are amazing and very loud. If ever needed I will definitely come back to this seller with no hesitation at all!

Molly Hatchet,Outlaws on loose...,"May 5, 2022",4,"Molly Hatchet appeared in the late summer of 1978 just in time to help Southern Rock fans get over their mourning over the loss of Lynyrd Skynyrd and the awful plane crash. Molly Hatchet was also from the same Jacksonville scene and no doubt rubbed shoulders with Van Zandt and co. during their formative years. A sextet rather than a septet (no piano player ala Billy Powell), Hatchet roared out of the box with a stunning debut that seemed to both pay tribute to their forebears (witness their stunning cover of the Allman’s “Dreams I’ll Never See) but also seemed to say that they had come to claim Skynyrd’s title as the top dog in Southern Rock (subtle put downs of where the other bands originally came from on the second track “Gator Country”). The LP opens with a band as “Bounty Hunter ''roars out of the gates ferociously announcing Molly Hatchet’s arrival and demonstating the barrelhouse pipes of singer and Ronnie sound alike Danny Joe Brown. Other key tracks include the aforementioned “Gator Country” (featuring a typical guitar workout outro) and “Dreams” in which Molly Hatchet radically reinterpret the Allman Brothers classic so that it sounds like an original. “The Creeper”, “Cheatin’ Woman” and “Big Apple” dish out steaming Southern hospitality and immediately endear the listener whether good ole boy or a Yankee like me. While it was immediately overshadowed by the follow-up ‘Flirtin’ with Disaster’ (the title track alone would forever define this band), I don’t think Molly Hatchet made a better record (other than ‘Flirtin’) after their first. Line-up changes would soon bedevil the band as Brown would soon leave after album 2 (though they maintain some momentum as ‘Beating the Odds’ also went mult-platinum) but it would not last much into the 1980’s. Molly Hatchet, much like fellow Jacksonville brethren Blackfoot, would compete rather proudly with the hard rock/heavy metal acts of their era and bring a heavier edge to Southern Rock. New York City you’re so big and tough?

"Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, 512GB, Midnight Green - Unlocked (Renewed Premium)","Had issues, but was taken care of by their support with a bonus! Super quick resolution.","July 28, 2022",5,"Quick Note: The test report screenshot shows three failed items. That's only due to me not having headphones to test at the time as well as the SIM card. I've a screenshot of speed test working on T-Mobile network LTE. So it works fine.

Initially I ordered an iPhone 11 Pro Max for my mother, 64GB version. Unfortunately, the ear piece wasn't working and contacted the seller via Amazon message center. I had to send the phone back in order to complete the replacement.

They provided the 2-day shipping label (sent out on Saturday, arrived there Monday). They kept in pretty close contact with me and that was good. They shipped Tuesday and received Thursday morning. So there's very little delay in getting the replacement.

Diagnostics checked out (see screenshots). The Earpiece tests that failed were due to me not having a headphone to try it on at the time. But I'm assuming it works and will edit if that changes.

The condition of the phone is near new! No blemishes on the body and screen looks really clean. There was very minute permanent lines in the screen that looked like smudges, but they with the sceen on, you don't notice it at all. PLUS they gave us a couple acrylic screen protectors, so that was a major plus!

The BONUS (at least for me)!
It turned out to be a blessing in disguise for me, because they ended up upgrading me to the 256GB model free (initially 64GB model). My mom didn't understand what that meant, and I pretty much explained that she can download apps and take photos to her hearts desire LOL.

It's a phone for mom, and she's coming from a Samsung A21 phone that had performance issues and wifi problems. Kept saying there's no internet and reboots in safemode. I wanted simplicity with Face-ID (which also works) that pretty much takes care of itself, and iOS delivers on that.

So ya, experienced issues. All devices will have a defect one way or the other (or none). You just need to contact their support and work with them before submitting your review. It annoys me when someone says ""It's defective"" with no resolution comments of what they ended up doing.

If I need another replacement phone, I'll definitely do business with them again.",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-512GB-Midnight-Green/dp/B08BHGY8M1/ref=sr_1_1?crid=VQR55RT0MHRH&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZI8JWYcXKdv2OxMa8qjuHSlp6wqcXoGkaEzxFoQP3p1Fbt8v9m9xIKO_lsqz4jvvWxTreEt1GtEQkxzOunlZkrx7GFLk-sMygzsvBLkjiExvrfO2V2evEL2Z3ttL7B0IDa5xztex-gTRGFy-yHtEWwn-EoYPkkDSs66qnJkPdGKFSdEpKGqITvWE9sSWzczHtfArES0pocW3djP6JyUjeo-132AKPfJsQoc597FcUSY7htJtzAqbVAjesdhLaPt1XMZC9v3Op8ARLUgnF90YykvvNY6I7I8u0X5NU5A_hh0.lSdFSlp5--2OJ1ii3kC682CIgZVbxznD0c4tgxmDN1A&dib_tag=se&keywords=iphone+11+pro&qid=1714425023&rnid=2941120011&s=wireless&sprefix=iphone+11+%2Caps%2C161&sr=1-1,2022

Perfect Blue [DVD],The rare case where the censored version is arguably better?,"March 7, 2022",4,"This headbending, ahead-of-its-time Hitchcockian thriller follows an actress whose attempt to break away from girl-group stardom to forge a more serious acting career goes frighteningly wrong. Soon, her sanity's fraying as she's stalked both by a real-world obsessive and, seemingly, by a mocking phantom version of the bright, cheerful stage persona she left behind. As her breakdown intensifies, director Satoshi Kon blurs reality and cinematic fiction in increasingly clever and unsettling ways, leading to a thrilling, reality-warping final chase sequence that takes full advantage of animation's power to tell stories in ways live action simply can't. Made at the dawn of the Internet age, the film's keen attention to all the ways the Web could be turned against women seems creepily prescient.

Unfortunately, that's not the only creepiness going on here. When I first saw this film about 20 years ago on DVD, I didn't realize I was watching a censored, R-rated version. The cuts made to get that rating -- primarily to the more graphic images in a murder sequence, a scene where the heroine's being pressured to take photographs with which she's not comfortable, and a final scene where someone's attempting to assault her -- didn't rob the film of any of its eerie power. And by suggesting, rather than showing, the grimier aspects of the narrative, they increased your sympathy for its heroine. (There's even some brilliantly deployed, near-subliminal fast cuts in the censored version, leaving you wondering whether you actually just saw what you thought you did -- which ties in really well to the film's overall theme!) The R-rated version critiques the heroine's exploitation without participating in it.

That version, alas, isn't even an option on this edition, which came as an unpleasant surprise to me. The original cut gets graphic in ways that feel like it's taking part in leering at its heroine, rather than siding with her. Maybe the filmmakers were trying to make you complicit in that process, but doing so makes the viewing process deeply, viscerally unpleasant in ways that seem to go far beyond any kind of artistic intent.

When those seedier aspects aren't shoved in your face, the film is brilliant -- a borderline masterpiece. I'd have no qualms rewatching and appreciating the R-rated cut for years to come. But the uncut original version's lack of restraint works against it, and leaves me uncertain about whether I'll ever feel up to watching it again.

If you want to give Kon's work a try -- and if you love movies, you absolutely should -- start instead with MILLENNIUM ACTRESS or especially TOKYO GODFATHERS, which harness all his considerable talents toward kinder, more humanist ends that a wider audience can enjoy.",https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Blue-Junko-Iwao/dp/B00000JL42/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3HSBCITO53ZR4&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.N2kFqWN-E9kfDqJAt7V2yQ.HDGkW32ft8qfB2n-JOTVJ2tqN2yOa0CdwoBVrQmgj44&dib_tag=se&keywords=B00000JL42&qid=1716379434&sprefix=b00000jl42%2Caps%2C343&sr=8-1,2022

"Motorola Moto G Stylus | 2023 | Unlocked | Made for US 4/64GB | 50 MP Camera | Glam Pink, 162.89 x 74.08 x 9.19mm",Good for the price! Don't let negative reviews scare you off.,"February 12, 2022",5,"Overall the Moto G Pure is a good phone for the money.

I do not play games or take a lot of photos. I do not have a lot of apps installed either. I use the phone for calls, texts, navigation, browsing the interwebs, and using a few apps (amazon, ebay, offer up, banking, health care). For these purposes, the phone is more than adequate. I am VERY happy with the purchase. I was going to use this phone as a temp phone until the new iPhone SE reviews came out. I like the G Pure so much that I might just keep it long term. So, if you have a similar use case, then do not be scared of the reviews showing horrible geekbench scores for the MediaTek Helios processor. Also, the near stock Android experience with no bloatware is refreshing. I like the little moto tweaks, like chopping twice for the flashlight.

However, there are some caveats:

There is no 5G and no NFC. So no google pay (do you trust google?). The lack of 5G is not a deal breaker for me as my carrier charges extra for 5G anyways.

The face unlock is unreliable (boo). I do not take selfies, so it could very well be that I am holding the phone incorrectly when trying to unlock the phone. However, I feel like an idiot moving the phone around trying to get the phone to unlock with facial recognition until the phone gives up and begs me to use fingerprint or PIN unlock. I was really hoping this feature was going to make me feel like I have a cheap iPhone. I was mistaken. This is not a deal breaker, but it is a let down.

The storage is a pitiful 32 GB. The OS alone with the preinstalled google aps uses about half of that. So if you have/need lots of apps look elsewhere. My previous 2017 phone also had the same amount of storage but more carrier bloatware. Still, the 32 GB feels cramped for me and will definitely feel cramped for most people.

The OS is android 11. This is already one version behind the current android 12 (at the date of purchase Feb. 2020), but the G Pure is supposed to get updated to android 12 and then that's probably it. This is the reason that I chose the G Pure over the G Play. The G Play has a bigger battery and a more commonly targeted Qualcomm processor. But the G Play has android 10 and will only get updated to android 11. Why does Motorola makes such good phones and have such a horrible update policy? If any Motorola bots are reading this, please note that I would buy a more expensive Motorola phone AND recommend Motorola to others if this were not the case. As it stands, I expect every Motorola phone purchase to result in being abandoned before you even get your new phone in the mail.

I know that there are more ""cons"" listed than ""pluses"", but I think some of the ""cons"" would be deal breakers for a lot of people. BUT, overall I am VERY happy with the purchase for my use case and expect to sue the phone for quite some time at the moment. So if you have similar needs, then you should expect to be happy as well.",https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Stylus-Unlocked-Camera-162-89/dp/B0BYLX9525/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3D7QGCEHHH5JU&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wMo2LxZcb8WqbIiajUrTasZivehaLp7FnVQFRTs337cFbhRVLzYMM6krl7Q_JOO8WD21sP490tmlZpB7ptQgwJ5XKFTP61BRoxrP9x5mCvLBoqSsIt4gG7q6tBnckwjyTNZndzm4BA6zSQolh9q0JMWAWo4pmJSmND6k6M5prSHJujNtXJ_H8eHr9l9A6juYrRefk3KICuEreVf7OO8EGRPii7OhixxOYrOGfIMe0Mgewk-LgER183fYDiDS9AO9XBRSvN3r60Gl14AI6y57cvOnXx7udreKQGV6phtOtCA.DsaalC0rA3KgygPNiEpxQbqyyQQHjG7LbJlgfaYZhzg&dib_tag=se&keywords=iphone%2B11&qid=1714426908&refinements=p_89%3AMotorola%7CTracFone&rnid=2528832011&s=wireless&sprefix=iphone%2B11%2B%2Caps%2C195&sr=1-1&th=1,2022

Heat [DVD],Nobody should miss this,"May 18, 2022",5,"Heat is a movie that you can rewatch time and time again. Its grounded setting in the city of LA is the backdrop of characters that are larger than life, each in their own ways. Regardless of their goals, each character deals with essential human emotions like drive, anger, and dread. There is no antagonist; if there is, it would be time. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro put on stunning performances, each at the peak of their careers (in my opinion), and the first scene they share is one of the most brilliant scenes in film, one I rewatch frequently. Matter of fact, I’m watching it right after I write this review. Watch this movie, witness Mann’s vision, experience the gripping action, listen to the surreal soundtrack, and have a great time.

On the BluRay, it’s a good version.
